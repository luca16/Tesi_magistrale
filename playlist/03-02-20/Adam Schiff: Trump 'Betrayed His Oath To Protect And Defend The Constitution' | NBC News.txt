members of the Senate mr. Chief Justice I want to close this portion of our statement by reading you the words of our dear friend and former colleague in the house the late Elijah Cummings who said this on the day that the speaker announced the beginning of the impeachment inquiry as elected representatives he said of the American people we speak not only for those who are here with us now but for generations yet unborn our voice is today our messages to a future we may never see when the history books are written about this tumultuous era I want them to show that I was among those in the House of Representatives who stood up to lawlessness and tyranny we the managers are not here representing ourselves alone or even just the house just as you are not here making determination as the president's guilt or innocence for yourselves alone now you and we represent the American people the ones at home and at work who are hoping that their country will remain what it has always believed it to be a beacon of hope of democracy and of inspiration to those striving around the world to create their own more perfect unions for those who are standing up to lawlessness and to tyranny Donald Trump has betrayed his Oh to protect and defend the Constitution but is not too late for us to honor ours to wield our power to defend our democracy as President Abraham Lincoln said at the close of his Cooper Union address on February 27 1869 let us be slandered by from our duty by false accusations against us nor frightened but from it by menaces of destruction to the government nor of dungeons to ourselves let us have faith that right makes might and in that faith led us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it today we urge you in the face of overwhelming evidence of the president's guilt and knowing that if left an officee will continue to seek foreign interfere in the next election to vote to convict on both articles of impeachment and to remove from office Donald J Trump the 45th President of the United States
