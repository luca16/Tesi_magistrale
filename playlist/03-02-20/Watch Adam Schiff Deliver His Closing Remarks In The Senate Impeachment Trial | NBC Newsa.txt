 mr. Chief Justice I want to begin by thanking you for the distinguished way you have presided over these proceedings senators we are not enemies but friends we must not be enemies if Lincoln could speak these words during the Civil War surely we can live them now and overcome our divisions and our animosities it is midnight in Washington the lights are finally going out in the Capitol after a long day in the impeachment trial of Donald J Trump the Senate heard arguments only hours earlier on whether to call witnesses and require the administration to release documents it has withheld counsel for the president still maintains the president's innocence while opposing any additional evidence that would prove otherwise it is midnight in Washington but on this night and all all the lights have been extinguished somewhere in the bowels of the Justice Department Donald Trump's Justice Department a light remains on someone has waited until the country is asleep to hit Send to inform the court in a filing due that day that the Justice Department the Department that would represent justice is refusing to produce documents directly bearing on the president's decision to withhold military aid from Ukraine the Trump administration has them it is not turning them over and it does not want the Senate to know until it is too late send that's what happened last Friday night when you left home for the weekend in a replay of the duplicity we saw during the trial when the president's lawyers argued here that the house must go to court and argued in court that the house must come here they were at it again telling the court in a midnight filing that it would not turn over relevant documents even as they argued here that they were not covering up the president's misdeeds midnight in Washington all too tragic a metaphor for where the country finds itself at the conclusion of the only the third Pietschmann in history and the first impeachment trial without witnesses or documents the first such trial or non trial in impeachment history how did we get here in the beginning of this proceeding you did not know whether we could prove our case many senators like many Americans did not have the opportunity to watch much let alone all of the open hearings in the house during our investigation and none of us could anticipate what defenses the president might offer now you have seen what we promised overwhelming evidence of the president's guilt Donald John Trump withheld hundreds of millions of dollars to an ally at war and a coveted White House meeting with their President to coerce or extort that nation's help to cheat in our elections and when he was found out he engaged in the most comprehensive effort to cover up his misconduct in the history of presidential impeachment fighting all subpoenas for documents and witnesses and using his own obstruction as a sword and a shield arguing here the house did not fight hard enough to overcome their non invocation of privilege in court and in court that the house must not be heard to enforce their subpoenas but that impeachment is a proper remedy having failed to persuade this Senate or the public that there was no quid pro quo having offered no evidence to contradict the record the president's team opted in a kind of desperation for a different kind of defense first prevent the Senate and the public from hearing from witnesses were the most damning accounts of the president's misconduct and second fall back on a theory of presidential power so broad and unaccountable that it would allow any occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania to be as corrupt as he chooses while the Congress is powerless to do anything about it that defense collapsed of its own dead weight presence may abuse their power with impunity they argued abuse of power is not a constitutional crime they claimed only statutory crime is a constitutional crime even though there were no statutory crimes when the Constitution was adopted the President had to look far and wide to find a defense lawyer to make such an argument unsupported by history the founders or common sense the Republican expert witness in the house would not make it serious constitutional scholars would not make it even Alan Dershowitz would not make it at least he wouldn't in 1998 but this has become the president's defense and yet this defense proved indefensible if abuse of power is not impeachable even though it is clear the founders considered the highest of all high crimes and misdemeanors but if it were not impeachable then a whole range of utterly unacceptable conduct in a president would now be beyond reach Trump could offer Alaska to the Russians in exchange for support in the next election or decide to move to mar-a-lago permanently and let Jared Kushner run the country delegating to him the decision whether to go to war because those things are not necessarily criminal this argument would allow that he could not be impeached for such abuses of power of course this would be absurd more than absurd it would be dangerous and so mr. dersh wits tried to embellish his legal creation and distinguish among those abuses of power which would be impeachable from those which wouldn't abuses a power that would help the president get reelected were permissible and therefore unimpeachable and only those four puny Airy gain were beyond the pale under this theory as long as a president believed his reelection was in the public interest he could do anything and no quid pro quo was to corrupt no damage to our national security to great this was such an extreme view that even the president's other lawyers had to run away from it so what are we left with the house has proven the president's guilt he tried to coerce an ally into helping him cheat by smearing his opponent he betrayed our national security in order to do it when he withheld military aid to our ally and violated the law to do so he covered it up and he covers it up still his continuing obstruction is a threat to the Oversight and investigate Ori powers of the House and Senate and if left unaddressed will permanently and dangerously alter the balance of power these undeniable facts required the president to retreat to his final defense he's guilty as sin but can't we just let the voters decide he's guilty as sin but why not let the voters clean up this mess and here to answer that question we must look at the history of this presidency and to the character of this president or lack of character and ask can we be confident that he will not continue to try to cheat in that very election can we be confident that Americans and not foreign powers will get to decide and that the president was shun any further foreign interference in our democratic affairs and the short plain sad incontestable answer is no you can't you can't trust this president to do the right thing not for one minute not for one election not for the sake of our country you just can't he will not change and you know it in 2016 he invited foreign interference in our election hey Russia if you're listening hack Hillary's emails he said and they did immediately and when the Russians started dumping them before the election he made use of them in every conceivable way touting the filthy lucre ad campaign stops more than a hundred times when he was investigated he did everything he could to obstruct justice going so far as to fire the FBI director and try to fire the special counsel and ask the White House Counsel to lie on his behalf during the same campaign while telling the country he had no business dealings with Russia he was continuing to actively pursue the most lucrative deal of his life a trump tower in the heart of Moscow six close associates of the president would be indicted or go to jail in connection with the president's campaign Russia and the effort to cover it up on the day after that tragic chapter appeared to come to an end with Bob Miller's testimony Donald Trump was back on the phone this time with another foreign power Ukraine and once again seeking foreign help with his election only this time he had the full powers of the presidency at his disposal this time he could use coercion this time he could withhold aid from a nation whose soldiers were dying every week this time he believed he could do whatever he wanted under Article two and this time when he was caught he could make sure that the Justice Department would never investigate the matter and they didn't Donald Trump had no more Jeff Sessions he had just the man he wanted in Bill Barr a man whose view of the imperial presidency a presidency in which the Department of Justice is little more than an extension of the White House Council is to do the president's bidding so Congress had to do the investigation itself and just as before he obstructed that investigation in every way he has not changed he will not change he has made that clear himself without self-awareness or hesitation a man without character or ethical compass will never find his way even as the most recent and most egregious misconduct was discovered he was unpolished and more dangerous undeterred he continued pressing Ukraine to smear his rivals even as the investigation was under way he invited new countries to get involved in the act calling on China to do the same his personal emissary Rudy Giuliani dispatched himself to Ukraine trying to
