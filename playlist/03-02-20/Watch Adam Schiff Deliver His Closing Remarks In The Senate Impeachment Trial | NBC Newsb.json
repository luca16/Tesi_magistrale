    "DOCUMENT" : "get further foreign interference in our election the plot goes on the scheming persists and the danger will never recede he has done it before he will do it again what are the odds if left in office that he will continue trying to cheat I will tell you 100 percent not 5 not 10 or even 50 but 100% if you have found him guilty and you do not remove him from office he will continue trying to cheat in the election until he succeeds then what shall you say what shall you say if Russia again interferes in our election and Donald Trump does nothing but celebrate their efforts what shall you say if Ukraine capitulates and announces investigations into the president's rivals what shall you say in future when candidates compete for the allegiant of foreign powers in their elections when they draft their platforms so to encourage foreign intervention in their campaign foreign nations as the most super of super PACs of them all if not legal somehow permissible because Donald Trump has made it so and we refuse to do anything about it but wring our hands they'll hack your opponent's emails they'll mount a social media campaign to support you they'll announce investigations of your opponent to help you and all for the asking leave Donald Trump in office after you have found him guilty and this is the future that you will invite now we have known since the day we brought these charges that the bar to conviction requiring fully two thirds of the Senate may be prohibitively high and yet the alternative is a runaway presidency and a nation whose elections are open to the highest bidder and so you might ask how given the gravity of the president's misconduct given the abundance of evidence of his guilt give acknowledgement by senators and both parties of that guilt how have we arrived here with so little common ground why was the Nixon impeachment bipartisan why was the Clinton impeachment much less so and why is the gulf between the parties even greater today it is not for the reason the president's lawyers would have you believe although they have claimed many times in many ways that the process in the house was flawed because we did not allow the president to control it it was in reality little different than the process in Prior impeachments the circumstances of course were different the Watergate investigation began in the Senate and it progressed before it got moving in the house and there of course much of the investigative work had been done by the special prosecutor Leon Jaworski in Clinton there was likewise an independent council that conducted a multi-year investigation that started with a real estate deal in Arkansas and ended with a blue dress Nixon and Clinton of course played no role in those investigations before they moved to the House Judiciary Committee but to the degree you can compare the process when it got to the Judiciary Committee in either prior and recent impeachments it was largely the same as we have here the President had the right to call witnesses to ask questions and chose not to the house majorities in Nixon and Clinton did not see their subpoena power to their minorities and neither did we here although then as now we gave the minority the right to request subpoenas and to compel a vote and they did so the due process the house presided here provided here was essentially the same and in some ways even greater nevertheless the president's counsel hopes that through sheer repetition they can convert non truth into truth do not let them every single court to hear mr. Philbin's arguments has rejected them the subpoenas are invalid rejected by the McGann Court they have absolute immunity rejected by the McGann our privilege may conceal crime or fraud rejected by the court in Nixon but if the process here was substantially the same the facts of the president's misconduct were very different from one impeachment to the next the Republican Party of Nixon's time broke into the DNC and the president covered it up Nixon too abused the power of his office to gain an unfair advantage over his opponent but in Watergate he never sought to coerce a foreign power to aid his reelection nor did he sacrifice our national security in such a palpable and destructive way as withholding aid from an ally at war and he certainly did not engage in the wholesale obstruction of Congress or justice that we have seen this president commitment the facts of the present Clinton's misconduct pale in comparison to Nixon and do not hold a candle to Donald Trump lying about an affair is morally wrong and when under oath it is a crime but it had nothing to do with his duties in office the process being the same the facts of president Trump's misconduct being far more destructive than either past president what then accounts for the disparate result in bipartisan support for his removal what has changed the short answer is we have changed the members of Congress have changed for reasons as varied as the Stars the members of this body and ours in the house are now far more accepting of the most serious misconduct of a president as long as it is a president of one's own party and that is a trend most dangerous for our country 50 years ago no lawyer representing the president would have ever made the outlandish argument that if the president believes his corruption will serve to get him reelected whether it is by coercing an ally to help him cheat or in any other form that he may not be impeached that this is somehow a permissible use of his power but here we are the argument has been made and some appear ready to accept it and that is dangerous for there is no limiting principle to that position it must have come as a shock a pleasant shock to this precedent that our norms and institutions would prove to be so weak the independence of the Justice Department and its formerly proud Office of Legal Counsel now mere legal tools at the president's disposal to investigate enemies or churn out helpful opinions not worth the paper they are written on the FBI painted by a president as corrupt and disloyal the intelligence community not to be trusted against the good counsel of Vladimir Putin the press portrayed as enemies of the people the daily attacks on the guardrails of our democracy so relentlessly assailed have made us numb and blind to the consequences does none of that matter anymore if he's the president of our party I hope and pray that we never have a president like Donald Trump in the Democratic Party one that would betray the national interests in the country's security to help with his re-election and I would hope to god that if we did we would impeach him and Democrats would lead the way but I suppose you never know just how difficult that is until you are confronted with it but you my friends are confronted with it you are confronted with that difficulty now and you must not shrink from it history will not be kind to Donald Trump I think we all know that not because it will be written by never Trump errs but because whenever we have departed from the values of our nation we have come to regret it and that regret is written all over the pages of our history if you find that the house has proved its case and still vote to acquit your name will be tied to his with a cord of steel and for all of history but if you find the courage to stand up to him to speak the awful truth to his rank falsehood your place will be among the David's who took on Goliath if only you will say enough we Revere the wisdom of our founders and the insights they had into self governance we scour their words for hidden meeting and try to place ourselves in their shoes but we have one advantage that the founders did not for all their genius they could not see but opaquely into the future we on the other hand of the advantage of time of seeing how their great experiment and self-governance has progressed when we look at the sweep of history there are times when our nation and the rest of the world have moved with a seemingly irresistible force in the direction of greater freedom more freedom to speak and to assemble to practice our faith and tolerate the faith of others to love whom we would and choose love over hate more free societies walls tumbling down nations reborn but then like a pendulum approaching the end of its arc the outward movement begins to arrest the golden globe of freedom reaches its zenith and starts to retreat the pendulum swings back past the center and recedes into a dark unknown how much farther will travel in its illiberal direction how many more freedoms will be extinguished before it turns back we cannot say but what we do here in this moment will affect its course and its correction every single vote even a single vote by a single member can change the course of history it is said that a single man or woman of courage makes a majority is there one among you who will say enough America believes a thing called truth she does not believe we are entitled to our own alternate facts she recoils at those who spread pernicious falsehoods to her truth matters there is nothing more corrosive to a democracy than the idea that there is no truth America also believes there is a difference between right and wrong and right matters here but there is more truth matters right matters but so does decency decency matters when the president smears a patriotic public servant like Murray ivanovitch in pursuit of a corrupt aim we recoil when the president mocks the disabled a war hero who is a prisoner of war or a Goldstar father we are appalled because decency matters here and when the president tries to coerce an ally to help him cheat in our elections and then covers it up we must say enough enough he has betrayed our national security and he will do so again luca@luca-P552LJ:~/Scrivania/playlist/nuove/03-02-20$\n",

court in Nixon but if the process here was substantially the same the facts of the president's misconduct were very different from one impeachment to the next the Republican Party of Nixon's time broke into the DNC and the president covered it up Nixon too abused the power of his office to gain an unfair advantage over his opponent but in Watergate he never sought to coerce a foreign power to aid his reelection nor did he sacrifice our national security in such a palpable and destructive way as withholding aid from an ally at war and he certainly did not engage in the wholesale obstruction of Congress or justice that we have seen this president commitment the facts of the present Clinton's misconduct pale in comparison to Nixon and do not hold a candle to Donald Trump lying about an affair is morally wrong and when under oath it is a crime but it had nothing to do with his duties in office the process being the same the facts of president Trump's misconduct being far more

have changed for reasons as varied as the Stars the members of this body and ours in the house are now far more accepting of the most serious misconduct of a president as long as it is a president of

you never know just how difficult that is until you are confronted with it but you my friends are confronted with it you are confronted with that difficulty now and you must not shrink from it history will not be kind to Donald Trump I think we all know that not because it will be written by never Trump errs but because whenever we have departed from the values of our nation we have come to regret

court in Nixon but if the process here was substantially the same the facts of the president's misconduct were very different from one impeachment to the next the Republican Party of Nixon's time broke into the DNC and the president covered it up Nixon too abused the power of his office to gain an unfair advantage over his opponent but in Watergate he never sought to coerce a foreign power to aid his reelection nor did he sacrifice our national security in such a palpable and destructive way as withholding aid from an ally at war and he certainly did not engage in the wholesale obstruction of Congress or justice that we have seen this president commitment the facts of the present Clinton's misconduct pale in comparison to Nixon and do not hold a candle to Donald Trump lying about an affair is morally wrong and when under oath it is a crime but it had nothing to do with his duties in office the process being the same the facts of president Trump's misconduct being far more destructive than either past president what then accounts for the disparate result in bipartisan support for his removal what has changed the short answer is we have changed the members of Congress have changed for reasons as varied as the Stars the members of this body and ours in the house are now far more accepting of the most serious misconduct of a president as long as it is a president of one's own party and that is a trend most dangerous for our country 50 years ago no lawyer representing the president would have ever made the outlandish argument that if the president believes his corruption will serve to get him reelected whether it is by coercing an ally to help him cheat or in any other form that he may not be impeached that this is somehow a permissible use of his power but here we are the argument has been made and some appear ready to accept it and that is dangerous for there is no limiting principle to that position it must have come as a shock a pleasant shock to this precedent that our norms and institutions would prove to be so weak the independence of the Justice Department and its formerly proud Office of Legal Counsel now mere legal tools at the president's disposal to investigate enemies or churn out helpful opinions not worth the paper they are written on the FBI painted by a president as corrupt and disloyal the intelligence community not to be trusted against the good counsel of Vladimir Putin the press portrayed as enemies of the people the daily attacks on the guardrails of our democracy so relentlessly assailed have made us numb and blind to the consequences does none of that matter anymore if he's the president of our party I hope and pray that we never have a president like Donald Trump in the Democratic Party one that would betray the national interests in the country's security to help with his re-election and I would hope to god that if we did we would impeach him and Democrats would lead the way but I suppose you never know just how difficult that is until you are confronted with it but you my friends are confronted with it you are confronted with that difficulty now and you must not shrink from it history will not be kind to Donald Trump I think we all know that not because it will be written by never Trump errs but because whenever we have departed from the values of our nation we have come to regret it and that regret is written all over the pages of our history if you find that the house has proved its case and still vote to acquit your name will be tied to his with a cord of steel and for all of history but if you find the courage to stand up to him to speak the awful truth to his rank falsehood your place will be among the David's who took on Goliath if only you will say enough we Revere the wisdom of our founders and the insights they had into self governance we scour their words for hidden meeting and try to place ourselves in their shoes but we have one advantage that the founders did not for all their genius they could not see but opaquely into the future we on the other hand of the advantage of time of seeing how their great experiment and self-governance has progressed when we look at the sweep of history there are times when our nation and the rest of the world have moved with a seemingly irresistible force in the direction of greater freedom more freedom to speak and to assemble to practice our faith and tolerate the faith of others to love whom we would and choose love over hate more free societies walls tumbling down nations reborn but then like a pendulum approaching the end of its arc the outward movement begins to arrest the golden globe of freedom reaches its zenith and starts to retreat the pendulum swings back past the center and recedes into a dark unknown how much farther will travel in its illiberal direction how many more freedoms will be extinguished before it turns back we cannot say but what we do here in this moment will affect its course and its correction every single vote even a single vote by a single member can change the course of history it is said that a single man or woman of courage makes a majority is there one among you who will say enough America believes a thing called truth she does not believe we are entitled to our own alternate facts she recoils at those who spread pernicious falsehoods to her truth matters there is nothing more corrosive to a democracy than the idea that there is no truth America also believes there is a difference between right and wrong and right matters here but there is more truth matters right matters but so does decency decency matters when the president smears a patriotic public servant like Murray ivanovitch in pursuit of a corrupt aim we recoil when the president mocks the disabled a war hero who is a prisoner of war or a Goldstar father we are appalled because decency matters here and when the president tries to coerce an ally to help him cheat in our elections and

aid his reelection nor did he sacrifice our national security in such a palpable and destructive way as withholding aid from an ally at war and he certainly did not engage in the wholesale obstruction of Congress or justice that we have seen this president commitment the facts of the present Clinton's misconduct pale in comparison to Nixon and do not hold a candle to Donald Trump lying about an affair is morally wrong and when under oath it is a crime but it had nothing to do with his duties in office the process being the same the facts of president Trump's misconduct being far more destructive than either past president what then accounts for the disparate result in bipartisan support for his removal what has changed the short answer is we have changed the members of Congress have changed for reasons as varied as the Stars the members of this body and ours in the house are now far more accepting of the most serious misconduct of a president as long as it is a president of one's own party and that is a trend most dangerous for our country 50 years ago no lawyer representing the president would have ever made the outlandish argument that if the president believes his corruption will serve to get him reelected whether it is by coercing an ally to help him cheat or in any other form that he may not be impeached that this is somehow a permissible use of his power but here we are the argument has been made and some appear ready to accept it and that is dangerous for there is no limiting principle to that position it must have come as a shock a pleasant shock to this precedent that our norms and institutions would prove to be so weak the independence of the Justice Department and its formerly proud Office of Legal Counsel now mere legal tools at the president's disposal to investigate enemies or churn out helpful opinions not worth the paper they are written on the FBI painted by a president as corrupt and disloyal the intelligence community not to be trusted against the good counsel of Vladimir Putin the press portrayed as enemies of the people the daily attacks on the guardrails of our democracy so relentlessly assailed have made us numb and blind to the consequences does none of that matter anymore if he's the president of our party I hope and pray that we never have a president like Donald Trump in the Democratic Party one that would betray the national interests in the country's security to help with his re-election and I would hope to god that if we did we would impeach him and Democrats would lead the way but I suppose you never know just how difficult that is until you are confronted with it but you my friends are confronted with it you are confronted with that difficulty now and you must not shrink from it history will not be kind to Donald Trump I think we all know that not because it will be written by never Trump errs but because whenever we have departed from the values of our nation we have come to regret it and that regret is written all over the pages of our history if you find that the house has proved its case and still vote to acquit your name will be tied to his with a cord of steel and for all of history but if you find the courage to stand up to him to speak the awful truth to his rank falsehood your place will be among the David's who took on Goliath if only you will say enough we Revere the wisdom of our founders and the insights they had into self governance we scour their words for hidden meeting and try to place ourselves in their shoes but we have one advantage that the founders did not for all their genius they could not see but opaquely into the future we on the other hand of the advantage of time of seeing how their great experiment and self-governance has progressed when we look at the sweep of history there are times when our nation and the rest of the world have moved with a seemingly irresistible force in the direction of greater freedom more freedom to speak and to assemble to practice our faith and tolerate the faith of others to love whom we would and choose love over hate more free societies walls tumbling down nations reborn but then like a pendulum approaching the end of its arc the outward movement begins to arrest the golden globe of freedom reaches its zenith and starts to retreat the pendulum swings back past the center and recedes into a dark unknown how much farther will travel in its illiberal direction how many more freedoms will be extinguished before it turns back we cannot say but what we do here in this moment will affect its course and its correction every single vote even a single vote by a single member can change the course of history it is said that a single man or woman of courage makes a majority is there one among you who will say enough America believes a thing called truth she does not believe we are entitled to our own alternate facts she recoils at those who spread pernicious falsehoods to her truth matters there is nothing more corrosive to a democracy than the idea that there is no truth America also believes there is a difference between right and wrong and right matters here but there is more truth matters right matters but so does decency decency matters when the president smears a patriotic public servant like Murray ivanovitch in pursuit of a corrupt aim we recoil when the president mocks the disabled a war hero who is a prisoner of war or a Goldstar father we are appalled because decency matters here and when the president tries to coerce an ally to help him cheat in our elections and then covers it up we must say enough enough he has betrayed our national security and he will do so again luca@luca-P552LJ:~/Scrivania/playlist/nuove/03-02-20$"

there is nothing more corrosive to a democracy than the idea that there is no truth America also believes there is a difference between right and wrong and right matters here but there is more truth

Philbin's arguments has rejected them the subpoenas are invalid rejected by the McGann Court they have absolute immunity rejected by the McGann our privilege may conceal crime or fraud rejected by the court in Nixon but if the process here was substantially the same the facts of the president's misconduct were very different from one impeachment to the next the Republican Party of Nixon's time broke into the DNC and the president covered it up Nixon too abused the power of his office to gain an unfair advantage over his opponent but in Watergate he never sought to coerce a foreign power to aid his reelection nor did he sacrifice our national security in such a palpable and destructive way as withholding aid from an ally at war and he certainly did not engage in the wholesale obstruction of Congress or justice that we have seen this president commitment the facts of the present Clinton's misconduct pale in comparison to Nixon and do not hold a candle to Donald Trump lying about an affair is morally wrong and when under oath it is a crime but it had nothing to do with his duties in office the process being the same the facts of president Trump's misconduct being far more destructive than either past president what then accounts for the disparate result in bipartisan support for his removal what has changed the short answer is we have changed the members of Congress have changed for reasons as varied as the Stars the members of this body and ours in the house are now far more accepting of the most serious misconduct of a president as long as it is a president of one's own party and that is a trend most dangerous for our country 50 years ago no lawyer representing the president would have ever made the outlandish argument that if the president believes his corruption will serve to get him reelected whether it is by coercing an ally to help him cheat or in any other form that he may not be impeached that this is somehow a permissible use of his power but here we are the argument has been made and some appear ready to accept it and that is dangerous for there is no limiting principle to that position it must have come as a shock a pleasant shock to this precedent that our norms and institutions would prove to be so weak the independence of the Justice Department and its formerly proud Office of Legal Counsel now mere legal tools at the president's disposal to investigate enemies or churn out helpful opinions not worth the paper they are written on the FBI painted by a president as corrupt and disloyal the intelligence community not to be trusted against the good counsel of Vladimir Putin the press portrayed as enemies of the people the daily attacks on the guardrails of our democracy so relentlessly assailed have made us numb and blind to the consequences does none of that matter anymore if he's the president of our party I hope and pray that we never have a president like Donald Trump in the Democratic Party one that would betray the national interests in the country's security to help with his re-election and I would hope to god that if we did we would impeach him and Democrats would lead the way but I suppose you never know just how difficult that is until you are confronted with it but you my friends are confronted with it you are confronted with that difficulty now and you must not shrink from it history will not be kind to Donald Trump I think we all know that not because it will be written by never Trump errs but because whenever we have departed from the values of our nation we have come to regret it and that regret is written all over the pages of our history if you find that the house has proved its case and still vote to acquit your name will be tied to his with a cord of steel and for all of history but if you find the courage to stand up to him to speak the awful truth to his rank falsehood your place will be among the David's who took on Goliath if only you will say enough we Revere the wisdom of our founders and the insights they had into self governance we scour their words for hidden meeting and try to place ourselves in their shoes but we have one advantage that the founders did not for all their genius they could not see but opaquely into the future we on the other hand of the advantage of time of seeing how their great experiment and self-governance has progressed when we look at the sweep of history there are times when our nation and the rest of the world have moved with a seemingly irresistible force in the direction of greater freedom more freedom to speak and to assemble to practice our faith and tolerate the faith of others to love whom we would and choose love over hate more free societies walls tumbling down nations reborn but then like a pendulum approaching the end of its arc the outward movement begins to arrest the golden globe of freedom reaches its zenith and starts to retreat the pendulum swings back past the center and recedes into a dark unknown how much farther will travel in its illiberal direction how many more freedoms will be extinguished before it turns back we cannot say but what we do here in this moment will affect its course and its correction every single vote even a single vote by a single member can change the course of history it is said that a single man or woman of courage makes a majority is there one among you who will say enough America believes a thing called truth she does not believe we are entitled to our own alternate facts she recoils at those who spread pernicious falsehoods to her truth matters there is nothing more corrosive to a democracy than the idea that there is no truth America also believes there is a difference between right and wrong and right matters here but there is more truth matters right matters but so does decency decency matters when the president smears a patriotic public servant like Murray ivanovitch in pursuit of a corrupt aim we recoil when the president mocks the disabled a war hero who is a prisoner of war or a Goldstar father we are appalled because decency matters here and when the president tries to coerce an ally to help him cheat in our elections and

Philbin's arguments has rejected them the subpoenas are invalid rejected by the McGann Court they have absolute immunity rejected by the McGann our privilege may conceal crime or fraud rejected by the court in Nixon but if the process here was substantially the same the facts of the president's misconduct were very different from one impeachment to the next the Republican Party of Nixon's time broke into the DNC and the president covered it up Nixon too abused the power of his office to gain an unfair advantage over his opponent but in Watergate he never sought to coerce a foreign power to aid his reelection nor did he sacrifice our national security in such a palpable and destructive way as withholding aid from an ally at war and he certainly did not engage in the wholesale obstruction of Congress or justice that we have seen this president commitment the facts of the present Clinton's misconduct pale in comparison to Nixon and do not hold a candle to Donald Trump lying about an affair is morally wrong and when under oath it is a crime but it had nothing to do with his duties in office the process being the same the facts of president Trump's misconduct being far more destructive than either past president what then accounts for the disparate result in bipartisan support for his removal what has changed the short answer is we have changed the members of Congress have changed for reasons as varied as the Stars the members of this body and ours in the house are now far more accepting of the most serious misconduct of a president as long as it is a president of one's own party and that is a trend most dangerous for our country 50 years ago no lawyer representing the president would have ever made the outlandish argument that if the president believes his corruption will serve to get him reelected whether it is by coercing an ally to help him cheat or in any other form that he may not be impeached that this is somehow a permissible use of his power but here we are the argument has been made and some appear ready to accept it and that is dangerous for there is no limiting principle to that position it must have come as a shock a pleasant shock to this precedent that our norms and institutions would prove to be so weak the independence of the Justice Department and its formerly proud Office of Legal Counsel now mere legal tools at the president's disposal to investigate enemies or churn out helpful opinions not worth the paper they are written on the FBI painted by a president as corrupt and disloyal the intelligence community not to be trusted against the good counsel of Vladimir Putin the press portrayed as enemies of the people the daily attacks on the guardrails of our democracy so relentlessly assailed have made us numb and blind to the consequences does none of that matter anymore if he's the president of our party I hope and pray that we never have a president like Donald Trump in the Democratic Party one that would betray the national interests in the country's security to help with his re-election and I would hope to god that if we did we would impeach him and Democrats would lead the way but I suppose you never know just how difficult that is until you are confronted with it but you my friends are confronted with it you are confronted with that difficulty now and you must not shrink from it history will not be kind to Donald Trump I think we all know that not because it will be written by never Trump errs but because whenever we have departed from the values of our nation we have come to regret it and that regret is written all over the pages of our history if you find that the house has proved its case and still vote to acquit your name will be tied to his with a cord of steel and for all of history but if you find the courage to stand up to him to speak the awful truth to his rank falsehood your place will be among the David's who took on Goliath if only you will say enough we Revere the wisdom of our founders and the insights they had into self governance we scour their words for hidden meeting and try to place ourselves in their shoes but we have one advantage that the founders did not for all their genius they could not see but opaquely into the future we on the other hand of the advantage of time of seeing how their great experiment and self-governance has progressed when we look at the sweep of history there are times when our nation and the rest of the world have moved with a seemingly irresistible force in the direction of greater freedom more freedom to speak and to assemble to practice our faith and tolerate the faith of others to love whom we would and choose love over hate more free societies walls tumbling down nations reborn but then like a pendulum approaching the end of its arc the outward movement begins to arrest the golden globe of freedom reaches its zenith and starts to retreat the pendulum swings back past the center and recedes into a dark unknown how much farther will travel in its illiberal direction how many more freedoms will be extinguished before it turns back we cannot say but what we do here in this moment will affect its course and its correction every single vote even a single vote by a single member can change the course of history it is said that a single man or woman of courage makes a majority is there one among you who will say enough America believes a thing called truth she does not believe we are entitled to our own alternate facts she recoils at those who spread pernicious falsehoods to her truth matters there is nothing more corrosive to a democracy than the idea that there is no truth America also believes there is a difference between right and wrong and right matters here but there is more truth matters right matters but so does decency decency matters when the president smears a patriotic public servant like Murray ivanovitch in pursuit of a corrupt aim we recoil when the president mocks the disabled a war hero who is a prisoner of war or a Goldstar father we are appalled because decency matters here and when the president tries to coerce an ally to help him cheat in our elections and

Philbin's arguments has rejected them the subpoenas are invalid rejected by the McGann Court they have absolute immunity rejected by the McGann our privilege may conceal crime or fraud rejected by the court in Nixon but if the process here was substantially the same the facts of the president's misconduct were very different from one impeachment to the next the Republican Party of Nixon's time broke into the DNC and the president covered it up Nixon too abused the power of his office to gain an unfair advantage over his opponent but in Watergate he never sought to coerce a foreign power to aid his reelection nor did he sacrifice our national security in such a palpable and destructive way as withholding aid from an ally at war and he certainly did not engage in the wholesale obstruction of Congress or justice that we have seen this president commitment the facts of the present Clinton's misconduct pale in comparison to Nixon and do not hold a candle to Donald Trump lying about an affair is morally wrong and when under oath it is a crime but it had nothing to do with his duties in office the process being the same the facts of president Trump's misconduct being far more destructive than either past president what then accounts for the disparate result in bipartisan support for his removal what has changed the short answer is we have changed the members of Congress have changed for reasons as varied as the Stars the members of this body and ours in the house are now far more accepting of the most serious misconduct of a president as long as it is a president of one's own party and that is a trend most dangerous for our country 50 years ago no lawyer representing the president would have ever made the outlandish argument that if the president believes his corruption will serve to get him reelected whether it is by coercing an ally to help him cheat or in any other form that he may not be impeached that this is somehow a permissible use of his power but here we are the argument has been made and some appear ready to accept it and that is dangerous for there is no limiting principle to that position it must have come as a shock a pleasant shock to this precedent that our norms and institutions would prove to be so weak the independence of the Justice Department and its formerly proud Office of Legal Counsel now mere legal tools at the president's disposal to investigate enemies or churn out helpful opinions not worth the paper they are written on the FBI painted by a president as corrupt and disloyal the intelligence community not to be trusted against the good counsel of Vladimir Putin the press portrayed as enemies of the people the daily attacks on the guardrails of our democracy so relentlessly assailed have made us numb and blind to the consequences does none of that matter anymore if he's the president of our party I hope and pray that we never have a president like Donald Trump in the Democratic Party one that would betray the national interests in the country's security to help with his re-election and I would hope to god that if we did we would impeach him and Democrats would lead the way but I suppose you never know just how difficult that is until you are confronted with it but you my friends are confronted with it you are confronted with that difficulty now and you must not shrink from it history will not be kind to Donald Trump I think we all know that not because it will be written by never Trump errs but because whenever we have departed from the values of our nation we have come to regret it and that regret is written all over the pages of our history if you find that the house has proved its case and still vote to acquit your name will be tied to his with a cord of steel and for all of history but if you find the courage to stand up to him to speak the awful truth to his rank falsehood your place will be among the David's who took on Goliath if only you will say enough we Revere the wisdom of our founders and the insights they had into self governance we scour their words for hidden meeting and try to place ourselves in their shoes but we have one advantage that the founders did not for all their genius they could not see but opaquely into the future we on the other hand of the advantage of time of seeing how their great experiment and self-governance has progressed when we look at the sweep of history there are times when our nation and the rest of the world have moved with a seemingly irresistible force in the direction of greater freedom more freedom to speak and to assemble to practice our faith and tolerate the faith of others to love whom we would and choose love over hate more free societies walls tumbling down nations reborn but then like a pendulum approaching the end of its arc the outward movement begins to arrest the golden globe of freedom reaches its zenith and starts to retreat the pendulum swings back past the center and recedes into a dark unknown how much farther will travel in its illiberal direction how many more freedoms will be extinguished before it turns back we cannot say but what we do here in this moment will affect its course and its correction every single vote even a single vote by a single member can change the course of history it is said that a single man or woman of courage makes a majority is there one among you who will say enough America believes a thing called truth she does not believe we are entitled to our own alternate facts she recoils at those who spread pernicious falsehoods to her truth matters there is nothing more corrosive to a democracy than the idea that there is no truth America also believes there is a difference between right and wrong and right matters here but there is more truth matters right matters but so does decency decency matters when the president smears a patriotic public servant like Murray ivanovitch in pursuit of a corrupt aim we recoil when the president mocks the disabled a war hero who is a prisoner of war or a Goldstar father we are appalled because decency matters here and when the president tries to coerce an ally to help him cheat in our elections and

court in Nixon but if the process here was substantially the same the facts of the president's misconduct were very different from one impeachment to the next the Republican Party of Nixon's time broke into the DNC and the president covered it up Nixon too abused the power of his office to gain an unfair advantage over his opponent but in Watergate he never sought to coerce a foreign power to aid his reelection nor did he sacrifice our national security in such a palpable and destructive way as withholding aid from an ally at war and he certainly did not engage in the wholesale obstruction of Congress or justice that we have seen this president commitment the facts of the present Clinton's misconduct pale in comparison to Nixon and do not hold a candle to Donald Trump lying about an affair is morally wrong and when under oath it is a crime but it had nothing to do with his duties in office the process being the same the facts of president Trump's misconduct being far more destructive than either past president what then accounts for the disparate result in bipartisan support for his removal what has changed the short answer is we have changed the members of Congress have changed for reasons as varied as the Stars the members of this body and ours in the house are now far more accepting of the most serious misconduct of a president as long as it is a president of one's own party and that is a trend most dangerous for our country 50 years ago no lawyer representing the president would have ever made the outlandish argument that if the president believes his corruption will serve to get him reelected whether it is by coercing an ally to help him cheat or in any other form that he may not be impeached that this is somehow a permissible use of his power but here we are the argument has been made and some appear ready to accept it and that is dangerous for there is no limiting principle to that position it must have come as a shock a pleasant shock to this precedent that our norms and institutions would prove to be so weak the independence of the Justice Department and its formerly proud Office of Legal Counsel now mere legal tools at the president's disposal to investigate enemies or churn out helpful opinions not worth the paper they are written on the FBI painted by a president as corrupt and disloyal the intelligence community not to be trusted against the good counsel of Vladimir Putin the press portrayed as enemies of the people the daily attacks on the guardrails of our democracy so relentlessly assailed have made us numb and blind to the consequences does none of that matter anymore if he's the president of our party I hope and pray that we never have a president like Donald Trump in the Democratic Party one that would betray the national interests in the country's security to help with his re-election and I would hope to god that if we did we would impeach him and Democrats would lead the way but I suppose you never know just how difficult that is until you are confronted with it but you my friends are confronted with it you are confronted with that difficulty now and you must not shrink from it history will not be kind to Donald Trump I think we all know that not because it will be written by never Trump errs but because whenever we have departed from the values of our nation we have come to regret it and that regret is written all over the pages of our history if you find that the house has proved its case and still vote to acquit your name will be tied to his with a cord of steel and for all of history but if you find the courage to stand up to him to speak the awful truth to his rank falsehood your place will be among the David's who took on Goliath if only you will say enough we Revere the wisdom of our founders and the insights they had into self governance we scour their words for hidden meeting and try to place ourselves in their shoes but we have one advantage that the founders did not for all their genius they could not see but opaquely into the future we on the other hand of the advantage of time of seeing how their great experiment and self-governance has progressed when we look at the sweep of history there are times when our nation and the rest of the world have moved with a seemingly irresistible force in the direction of greater freedom more freedom to speak and to assemble to practice our faith and tolerate the faith of others to love whom we would and choose love over hate more free societies walls tumbling down nations reborn but then like a pendulum approaching the end of its arc the outward movement begins to arrest the golden globe of freedom reaches its zenith and starts to retreat the pendulum swings back past the center and recedes into a dark unknown how much farther will travel in its illiberal direction how many more freedoms will be extinguished before it turns back we cannot say but what we do here in this moment will affect its course and its correction every single vote even a single vote by a single member can change the course of history it is said that a single man or woman of courage makes a majority is there one among you who will say enough America believes a thing called truth she does not believe we are entitled to our own alternate facts she recoils at those who spread pernicious falsehoods to her truth matters there is nothing more corrosive to a democracy than the idea that there is no truth America also believes there is a difference between right and wrong and right matters here but there is more truth matters right matters but so does decency decency matters when the president smears a patriotic public servant like Murray ivanovitch in pursuit of a corrupt aim we recoil when the president mocks the

aid his reelection nor did he sacrifice our national security in such a palpable and destructive way as withholding aid from an ally at war and he certainly did not engage in the wholesale obstruction of Congress or justice that we have seen this president commitment the facts of the present Clinton's misconduct pale in comparison to Nixon and do not hold a candle to Donald Trump lying about an affair is morally wrong and when under oath it is a crime but it had nothing to do with his duties in office the process being the same the facts of president Trump's misconduct being far more destructive than either past president what then accounts for the disparate result in bipartisan support for his removal what has changed the short answer is we have changed the members of Congress have changed for reasons as varied as the Stars the members of this body and ours in the house are now far more accepting of the most serious misconduct of a president as long as it is a president of one's own party and that is a trend most dangerous for our country 50 years ago no lawyer representing the president would have ever made the outlandish argument that if the president believes his corruption will serve to get him reelected whether it is by coercing an ally to help him cheat or in any other form that he may not be impeached that this is somehow a permissible use of his power but here we are the argument has been made and some appear ready to accept it and that is dangerous for there is no limiting principle to that position it must have come as a shock a pleasant shock to this precedent that our norms and institutions would prove to be so weak the independence of the Justice Department and its formerly proud Office of Legal Counsel now mere legal tools at the president's disposal to investigate enemies or churn out helpful opinions not worth the paper they are written on the FBI painted by a president as corrupt and disloyal the intelligence community not to be trusted against the good counsel of Vladimir Putin the press portrayed as enemies of the people the daily attacks on the guardrails of our democracy so relentlessly assailed have made us numb and blind to the consequences does none of that matter anymore if he's the president of our party I hope and pray that we never have a president like Donald Trump in the Democratic Party one that would betray the national interests in the country's security to help with his re-election and I would hope to god that if we did we would impeach him and Democrats would lead the way but I suppose you never know just how difficult that is until you are confronted with it but you my friends are confronted with it you are confronted with that difficulty now and you must not shrink from it history will not be kind to Donald Trump I think we all know that not because it will be written by never Trump errs but because whenever we have departed from the values of our nation we have come to regret it and that regret is written all over the pages of our history if you find that the house has proved its case and still vote to acquit your name will be tied to his with a cord of steel and for all of history but if you find the courage to stand up to him to speak the awful truth to his rank falsehood your place will be among the David's who took on Goliath if only you will say enough we Revere the wisdom of our founders and the insights they had into self governance we scour their words for hidden meeting and try to place ourselves in their shoes but we have one advantage that the founders

we look at the sweep of history there are times when our nation and the rest of the world have moved with a seemingly irresistible force in the direction of greater freedom more freedom to speak and to assemble to practice our faith and tolerate the faith of others to love whom we would and choose love over hate more free societies walls tumbling down nations reborn but then like a pendulum approaching the end of its arc the outward movement begins to arrest the golden globe of freedom reaches its zenith and starts to retreat the pendulum swings back past the center and recedes into a

course and its correction every single vote even a single vote by a single member can change the course of history it is said that a single man or woman of courage makes a majority is there one among you who will say enough America believes a thing called truth she does not believe we are entitled to our own alternate facts she recoils at those who spread pernicious falsehoods to her truth matters there is nothing more corrosive to a democracy than the idea that there is no truth America also believes there is a difference between right and wrong and right matters here but there is more truth matters right matters but so does decency decency matters when the president smears a patriotic public servant like Murray ivanovitch in pursuit of a corrupt aim we recoil when the president mocks the

broke into the DNC and the president covered it up Nixon too abused the power of his office to gain an unfair advantage over his opponent but in Watergate he never sought to coerce a foreign power to aid his reelection nor did he sacrifice our national security in such a palpable and destructive way as withholding aid from an ally at war and he certainly did not engage in the wholesale obstruction of Congress or justice that we have seen this president commitment the facts of the present Clinton's misconduct pale in comparison to Nixon and do not hold a candle to Donald Trump lying about an

have changed for reasons as varied as the Stars the members of this body and ours in the house are now far more accepting of the most serious misconduct of a president as long as it is a president of
