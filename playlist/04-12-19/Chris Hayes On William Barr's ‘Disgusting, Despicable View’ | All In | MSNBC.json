    "DOCUMENT" : "there are plenty of lackeys and zealots that populate the Trump ministration but Attorney General William bar has truly distinguished himself by being both bar has done everything he can to do the president's bidding and greatly imperiled the Justice Department's independence in doing so and that includes flagrantly misleading the public about the Mullah report it includes refusing to recuse himself from anything connected to the whistleblower report or the impeachment inquiry even though Trump when he was trying to extort the Ukrainian president literally told presents let's cue to talk to two people Rudy Giuliani and his buddy attorney general Barr who he sees as his right-hand man the bar is not just a lackey he is also a zealot he's given a series of speeches this year that are wildly partisan and truly unnerving espousing what appears to be a deeply held belief that Christian conservatives and their ilk are under savage relentless attack by evil liberals we need to fight back to keep the barbarians at bay and then yesterday during an award ceremony for a distinguished service and policing attorney general Barr said this but I think today American people have to focus on something else which is the sacrifice and the service that is given by our law enforcement officers and they have to start showing more than they do the respect and support that law-enforcement deserves and if communities don't give that support and respect they might find themselves without the police protection they need we asked the Department of Justice to clarify what the Attorney General said and they declined to respond on the record but what bar appears to be suggesting there is that if communities don't give police the quote respect and support that he feels they should well maybe the police won't reject them at all and if that's what he's saying it is a disgusting despicable view every single American whether they show due deference to police or not whatever their political views or feelings about law enforcement every American deserves the protections and safety of our representative democracy and state that's bedrock we don't pick and choose we are not feudal serfs who have to be nice to the Lord for protection it's not the way America works it's the chief law enforcement officer of the entire country to suggest otherwise the kind of veiled threat to those he feels are insufficiently thankful that is absolutely unacceptable hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click Subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos\n",
