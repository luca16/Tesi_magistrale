halli this is uncharted territory for the president it is Lester it's his fourth formal address here but never one like this he'll be facing the House Democrats who impeached him and the senator is likely to acquit him tomorrow sources familiar with the planning of the speech tell us the president is not likely to talk much or focus much on impeachment and instead lay out with one senior administration official calls a discussion about the great American comeback hitting on the economy on immigration on national security NBC News has also learned that Venezuelan opposition leader Wan hua doe will be a surprise guest at tonight's State of the Union the president himself is downplaying expectations promising what he calls extraordinarily low-key comments rather than a victory lap ahead of tomorrow's final vote on those impeachment proceedings all eyes now on red state Democrats to see if some of them may break ranks and vote to acquit President Trump   the drive to impeach President Trump did not begin with the allegations before us here was reporting in April of 2016 this is before the president was the nominee Donald Trump isn't even the Republican nominee yet but impeachment he's already on the lips of pundits newspaper editorials constitutional scholars and even a few members of Congress here was the Washington Post headline minutes after president Trump's inauguration the campaign to impeach President Trump has begun The Washington Post said the articles of impeachment before us were not even the first ones House Democrats introduced this was a go-around number this was a go-around number of roughly seven those previously alleged high crimes and misdemeanors mr. president including things like being impolite to the press and to professional athletes it insults the intelligence of the American people to pretend this is a solemn process reluctantly begun because of withheld foreign aid no Washington Democrats position on this president's been clear literally for years just as Democrats such as the current Democratic leader and then Senator Joe Biden argued at length in 1999 we recognized that Senate traditions impose no obligation no obligation to hear new live witness testimony if it is not necessary to decide the case if it is not necessary to decide the case let me emphasize the house managers themselves said over and over that additional testimony was not necessary to prove their case they claimed dozens of times that their existing case was quote overwhelming and incontrovertible that was the house managers saying their evidence was overwhelming and incontrovertible we have indeed witnessed and abuse of power a grave abuse of power by just the kind of House Majority that the framers warned us about so tomorrow tomorrow the Senate must do what we were created to do we've done our duty we've considered all the arguments we've studied the quote mountain of evidence end quote and tomorrow we'll vote we must vote to reject the house abuse of power vote to protect our institutions vote to new precedents that would reduce the framers design to rubble vote to keep factional fever from boiling over and scorching our Republic I urge every one of our colleagues to cast the vote the facts the evidence the Constitution and the common good clearly require vote to acquit the president of these charges
