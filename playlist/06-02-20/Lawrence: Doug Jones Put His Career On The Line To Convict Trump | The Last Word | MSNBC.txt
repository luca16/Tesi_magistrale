 we're gonna use the word courage tonight it's a word that doesn't come up much on this program because this hour is mostly devoted to politics and government as it will be tonight and so when we talk about courage tonight we'll be talking about political courage we're not talking about the kind of courage it takes to go into military combat or to go into a coal mine we're not talking about Sully Sullenberger courage we're talking about that very very low grade of courage that we very rarely see in politicians and it is precisely because we see it so rarely that we will spend some time tonight honoring political courage if we don't honor political courage when we see it then we will see less of it much less because I worked on the Democratic staff of the United States Senate for several years I still have the Senate staff reaction on days like today and I know that I was joined by hundreds maybe even thousands of Senate staffers who were watching on their televisions in their offices in the three Senate office buildings when Mitt Romney became the first senator in history today to vote against a president of his own party in a Senate impeachment trial verdict I jumped out of my chair and for the first time in my life I cheered Mitt Romney mr. Romney mr. Romney guilty that was political courage historic political courage we will have much more to say about Mitt Romney throughout this hour but what Mitt Romney did was not the most courageous thing that happened on the Senate floor today Mitt Romney won 62% of the vote in Utah and is not up for reelection until 2024 when this vote and possibly even Donald Trump will be long forgotten voting against your party is not the only form of political courage in fact when I was working in the Senate that didn't take any courage at all senators from both parties in the 1990s routine he voted against their parties and no one thought that that was courageous then but casting a vote in the Senate that makes your own re-election more difficult has always been the most politically courageous thing a senator can do Doug Jones did that today Doug Jones won his Senate seat in Alabama with forty nine point nine seven percent of the vote in a special election in 2017 he was the first Democrat to Ana Senate seat in Alabama since 1992 when Richard Shelby won re-election as a Democrat but Richard Shelby found life as a Democrat in Alabama so impossible that he changed parties two years later and is still sitting in the Senate as a Republican senator who voted not guilty today after jug Doug Jones voted guilty guilty on both articles of impeachment life was hard enough for a Democratic senator from Alabama when Doug Jones woke up this morning and when he rose to speak in the Senate today Doug Jones I fear that moral courage country before party is a rare commodity these days we can write about it and talk about it in speeches and in the media but it is harder to put into action when political careers may be on the line Doug Jones put his political career on the line today standing at the desk that was used by the young Massachusetts Senator John F Kennedy before he became president of the United States Doug Jones put his political career on the line today because in his words it is simply a matter of right and wrong the evidence clearly proves that the president use the weight of his office and the weight of the United States government to seek to coerce a foreign government to interfere in our election for his personal political benefit his actions were more than simply in appropriate they were an abuse of power I believe that the president deliberately and unconstitutionally obstructed Congress by refusing to cooperate with the investigation in any way the president's actions demonstrate a belief that he is above the law accordingly I will vote to defect the president on both articles of impeachment I am mindful mr. president that I am standing at a desk that once was used by John F Kennedy who famously wrote profiles and courage and there will be so many who will simply look at one reason that I am working so hard to build a grassroots movement all across this nation is so that we have the strength come November 2020 not only to win at the top of the ticket but to have that kind of on-the-ground power and operation that helps us win up and down the ticket and that's a big part of how we're going to take back the Senate and expand our lead in the house and take Senate take seats in state legislative offices that's what we got to do as Democrats I also really have to put in the plug for all the things president can do all by herself and and put real meat on that bone we can start the fight against climate change on my first day as president I'll stop all new drilling or mining on federal lands no offshore drilling you can start to make a real difference we can also do it through our agencies I'm gonna have a Secretary of Education so it's been a public school teacher someone who actually believes in public education and believes that public dollars should stay in public schools so there's a lot to do and I'm in that fight but I'll tell you my first legislative fight with Mitch McConnell if we've got to have it and that is I've got the biggest anti-corruption plan since Watergate and people support it across this country we have a government where the government works for those at the top and doesn't work for anyone else where big corporations like Amazon and Eli Lilly and others have figured out that they can just invest in government and get tax loopholes so what did they do last year they made billions of dollars in profits paying zero in taxes that is corruption pure and simple and here's the thing it's not just Democrats who think that corruption is disgusting its independence and Republicans maybe not the folks who serve in public office in Washington but people across this country so here's the fight I'm willing to have I'm willing to get out there and fight for an anti-corruption bill right from the beginning to get our Democrats together our end tenants together are Republicans together all across this country we get that strong grassroots movement that we build in order to win the election keep it alive don't let people go home keep them in the fight get them pushing Washington at the same time I'm leading from the White House that's how we get this government to represent the people that's how we get this government to do the people's bitten us the bidding of the rich and the powerful that's how we make a real difference and anybody who's watching this who thinks that's a good idea to get government to work for the people should go to Elizabeth Warren calm pitch in five bucks be part of this fight because it is our democracy ultimately that we're talking about Mitch McConnell should not be there to block our democracy thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on the button below for more from the last word and the rest of MSNBC   I want to start with something that Mitt Romney said because I want to ask you about something similar that shaped your thinking let's listen to what Mitt Romney said was going through his mind about the importance of this vote and what he will tell his children I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability believing that my country expected it of me senator Jones you talked about your father we heard Mitt Romney talk about his children you began by talking about your father and what this kind of vote would mean to him and how your father would approach a decision like this I did you know I lost my dad just about a month ago and he stays with me so much throughout this entire process and he his principles were of right and wrong his principles he was a strong man and he really was a patriot and he put his country above just about anything else and at the end of the day that's what we should all do that's what the oath of office as a u.s. senator is it's what our oath of office to do impartial justice is and I thought about him I thought about my kids I thought about my grandkids and what I would want them to see and say about their their father and their grandfather down the road when history is going to be our judge and I really believe that those of us who voted the way we did today to convict the president will ultimately be judged on but you know on the right side of history and senator I can tell you having worked in the Senate for years I can count on just a couple of fingers how many times I have seen a United States Senator put his or her career on the line with a Senate vote you did that today how much of the weight of that did you feel in doing that you know Lawrence I know this is going to come as a surprise for folks because I think as so many people especially in the media when the polarize atmosphere that we have today everything is seen through some kind of political partisan lens but that really did not enter my thinking in this I really looked at the weight of this was on my shoulders as a constitutional perspective this is the most sacred right that we have the right to vote to make sure that the will of the people stay intact and to try to remove a prize the United States to consider that and ultimately have to cast a vote one way or another that's the way I felt it really wasn't a political weight it was purely the way to the Constitution what the Founding Father said and what I believed it to be the future I wanted my vote to be a message for future presidents and for future congresses as to where we need to be as a people and what need we need to be looking for in the next president the United States and this President of the United States thanks for checking out
