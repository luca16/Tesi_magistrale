McConnell not guilty the president acquitted of abusing power and obstructing Congress Donald John Trump be and he is hereby acquitted of the charges in said articles but the vote was not on party lines not after Utah Republican Mitt Romney chose to convict the President on one of the charges pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rivals the president's purpose was personal and political Democrats stayed united mr. Manchin guilty how damaging is it that this is now not a bipartisan approach was a bipartisan opposition to the impeachment articles themselves it would have taken 67 senators to remove the president after House Democrats impeached him but given the Chamber's Republican majority that always seemed a non-starter the state of our union is stronger than ever before it comes at a moment of bitter partisanship after a State of the Union speech that began with an apparent missed handshake and ended with ripped remarks House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defending her decision to tear up her copy of the President's speech moments after he delivered it Vinson was a man truth vice president pence firing battery and I think it was a new low I wasn't sure if she was ripping up the speech or ripping up the Constitution the state of our union tonight divide it Hallie Jackson NBC News Capitol Hill\n",
