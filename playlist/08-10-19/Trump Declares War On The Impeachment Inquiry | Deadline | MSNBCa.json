    "DOCUMENT" : "Trump has declared war on the house impeachment inquiry the perils for the president in doing so are immense and could include adding a separate article of impeachment for obstructing the inquiry that of course was one of the Nixon articles of impeachment dog trunks turning to stonewalling as the impeachment inquiry is soaring in terms of support from the American public adopting the defiant posture of obstructing a probe that 58% of the American public supports including nearly a third of Republicans and so potentially damaging to the president politically that it's leading to questions today about what exactly the president is afraid that the diplomat scheduled to testify today would reveal New York Times writes this quote the decision to block Gordon Sandlin the US ambassador to the EU from speaking with three investigators for three House committees came just hours before he was to appear on Capitol Hill provoking an immediate conflict with potentially profound consequences for the inquiry and for the President himself despite the Trump administration pulling the plug on today's planned testimony early this morning there's already ample evidence from sunland's text messages with other diplomats that he was deeply involved in the effort to get the Ukrainian president to investigate the Biden's there's also a smoking gun text exchange in which he's confronted with the concern from another diplomat that military aid had been tied to the Ukrainians digging up dirt on the president's rival diplomat Bill Taylor wrote songline quote as I said on the phone I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help at the political campaign the New York Times reports on what's onlin did after he got that text message quote after receiving the text mr. Soglin called mr. Trump who asserted it was false sunlen then replied to Taylor's message bill I believe you are incorrect about president Trump's intentions the president has been crystal clear no quid pro quos of any kind and added quote I suggest we stop the back-and-forth by text now NBC News has confirmed today that Sandlin spoke with the president before sending that awfully on message or reply and adds that there are more text messages between the officials that haven't yet been released to the public and if the substance of all those communication or something that White House lawyers felt so good about seems to me Salman would be up on Capitol Hill right now telling that story and Donald Trump would be live tweeting his own exoneration but he's not and that is where we start today with some of our favorite reporters in France with us at the table White House reporter for The Washington Post Ashley Parker former acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal national political reporter for Axios Jonathan Swan and former US attorney and former senior FBI official Chuck Rosenberg let me start with you Neal it would seem that we already have a lot of evidence from this witness all of it pretty incriminating for this president what is the impact it seems like the cons outweigh the pros unless there's something I'm missing yeah no there's something huge going on here because coming in the president I think was suffering from the fact that there's all these text messages all this stuff that shows Trump is guilty so really his only hope was to have his pal Sandlin come in and say oh no that wasn't the case trying to explain what happened and the like in three hours before he's testified the White House pulls the plug on that that's really suggestive of the fact that I think Sandlin was going to come in and do note the president no favors the wind was definitely not at the president's back and now it's blowing him down and remember sunland's not just some person he's a guy who works for you and me the taxpayers he's a public official and they're blocking him from testifying something that there must be scared that he's going to say something bad can we go through the evidence that I just laid out so this this the US was Bill Taylor who's a diplomat working in Ukraine sends a text and says I think it's crazy to tie the military a for Ukraine to a political campaign and instead of writing back no no that's not what we're doing ET phones home and talks to the president who's told more than 11,000 lies and then gives that president's word to Bill Taylor the diplomat but no no there's no quid pro quo and unless their messages we haven't seen he didn't ask if there was a quid pro quo quid pro quo seems to have been the cover story for these shenanigans from the beginning absolutely we don't even know that the president said Sandlin oh there was no quid pro quo what we have is a text message five hours after the one before it saying hey this is crazy how can you tie this and it's written and scripted like a bad lawyer would write it like to a drug dealer like oh when you said coke coke you meant coca-cola and speaking slowly or something like that you know it's that the whole layout of the text messages one to another is incredibly suspicious Oh their messages before from Taylor and Sandlin we're minutes or seconds apart then there's this five hour gap and then there's this highly scripted response and of course though all the other evidence Nicole is pretty damaging as well from the memo that the White House sent over the July 25th phone call to the whistleblower report all of this stuff is coming out and this whistleblower is looking more and more like the one person who's told the truth from day one and we've got some breaking news about the whistleblower but but but just quickly on the evidence that are exists a former law enforcement official told me that if Sandlin and kurt volker who's the one diplomat who testified and whose testimony yielded all these rich sort of windows into what they were asking the Ukrainians to do that they wanted this investigation into the Biden's that it that apparate operation had been rogue the diplomats would have been fired that that the the sign that indicates most clearly that the orders came from on high either from Pompeo or Donald Trump where that those diplomats were not sanctioned or punished and then if they testify they may be asked well who told you to tie the investigation of the Biden's and by the way career diplomats like mr. Keller don't tend to go rogue I mean they are used to receiving instructions and following them and so I think your instincts Nicole are exactly right by the way I also think Neil's instincts are right it is scripted and that to federal prosecutors like me seems suspicious but I wanted to add one thing if I could it doesn't matter in some ways that mr. Sandlin does not go in to testify that happens all the time right we don't always get all the evidence we want and investigations documents are missing witnesses don't tell the truth I mean good investigators good agents build cases with imperfect information I mean is it troubling that is not testifying of course what I like to hear from you back but can you make a case whether it's a criminal case or impeachment without them happens all the time and it would seem Jonathan Swan that this White House is running the Muller PlayBook in a very very very different landscape the Muller probe took place behind closed doors there really weren't a lot of witnesses there was a big report that came out at the end but this is the conduct in question happened on the White House property the transcript was released by the White House there's really no strawman to point to there's no deep State this is Donald Trump's words released in Donald Trump's transcript by Donald Trump's aides and this is a trump appointed ambassador I think the view certainly from the president is that by saying things out loud in public and transparently they are less bad than if he said exactly the same words privately in an email or on a phone call and it's we're sort of seeing something that we've never really seen before which is basically testing the public I mean know people who used to work in the administration the very same level who was stunned when he released that transcript they were stunned they thought I mean when he was saying I'm going to put it out tomorrow it's perfect they were expecting like you know a perfect vocal and of course we saw we saw but this is what they're doing he's saying it out loud and he's betting that by telling his people that this is perfect that his people will agree with that and go along with that it's it's quite remarkable the other problem they seem to have is that they've moved the goalposts several times they're there their position now seems to be as long\n",

Keller don't tend to go rogue I mean they are used to receiving instructions and following them and so I think your instincts Nicole are exactly right by the way I also think Neil's instincts are right it is scripted and that to federal prosecutors like me seems suspicious but I wanted to add one thing if I could it doesn't matter in some ways that mr. Sandlin does not go in to testify that happens all the time right we don't always get all the evidence we want and investigations documents are missing witnesses don't tell the truth I mean good investigators good agents build cases with imperfect information I mean is it troubling that is not testifying of course what I like to hear from you back but can you make a case whether it's a criminal case or impeachment without them happens all the time and it would seem Jonathan Swan that this White House is running the Muller PlayBook in a very very very different landscape the Muller probe took place behind closed doors there really weren't a lot of witnesses there was a big report that came out at the end but this is the conduct in question happened on the White House property the transcript was released by the White House there's really no strawman to point to there's no deep State this is Donald Trump's words released in Donald Trump's transcript by Donald Trump's aides and this is a trump appointed ambassador I think the view certainly from the president is that by saying things out loud in public and transparently they are less bad than if he said exactly the same words privately in an email or on a phone call and it's we're sort of seeing something that we've never really seen before which is basically testing the public I mean know people who used to work in the administration the very same level who was stunned when he released that transcript they were stunned they thought I mean when he was saying I'm going to put it out tomorrow it's perfect they were expecting like you know a perfect vocal and of course we saw we saw but this is what they're doing he's saying it out loud and he's betting that by telling his people that this is perfect that his people will agree with that and go along with that it's it's quite remarkable the other problem they seem to have is that they've moved the goalposts several times they're there their position now seems to be as long"
