    "DOCUMENT" : "as they can't prove a quid pro quo I'm I'm fine I'm I'm free I that is that was it right that seems to be their public relations strategy if not their legal one all of the evidence that has emerged suggests that everyone that worked for him was operating as though there was absolutely a quid pro quo that both a visit to the White House and the release of the military it was absolutely tied to the Ukrainians enthusiasm and willingness and commitment in writing to investigating the Biden's so how do they feel like there are no quid pro quo defenses holding up there no quid pro quo defense seems to be that literally no one said hey let's do a quid pro quo but it at the diplomat who's said in writing that we got right who say who said he was worried that it seems like a quid pro quo and then the other diplomat said just to be clear this is calling on okay this this isn't a quid pro quo but there there were people it's Jonathan's point it's mixed because there are the president true lead when he released the transcript he truly did believe that it was a perfect call he did believe that it was totally appropriate and there were people inside the administration who even before they read the transcript or knew about it they they thought you know what I think the president's definition of perfect and totally appropriate is a little different than mine and is a little different than the public's and so they were they were worried about that going forward and so that's kind of the White House defense and then just to bring it to the Republicans briefly a lot of their defenses you see a lot of Republican lawmakers getting very squirrely when they're pressed on do you think this call was appropriate would you have asked for the same thing talking to the Ukrainian president but Republicans will sort of say I don't think this is impeachable they don't necessarily condone the content but they their sort of their argument is is both I believe he was joking and that I'm not prepared to say this is ideal but nor does it reach the level of impeachment so just one point I disagree with Neil on the Sunland on the way the way I was thinking about the sodden one thing I don't think they thought this guy was going to bring them down was going to come in and sort of be very damaging in his testimony in fact he is signaled that he's basically going to say very nice things then there obviously is the worry about the inconsistency in which you know he apparently told Johnson then so no doubt but the why it's much bigger than this the White House is going to put out probably pretty soon their legal guidance for how they're going to handle this thing which is basically to D legitimize the whole thing and they believe by sending anyone to the hill they give it some little bit of approval or legitimacy as much bigger they just want to say to hell with you guys we're not cooperating we're not getting involved in this and maybe there were people who were concerned about solar it's very possible about that one thing but it's much bigger it's they don't want to legitimize I just got the idea that Soglin was going to try and intend to be helpful he had million dollar man after all he donated million dollars to tracts inauguration but I think the problem in any law enforcement or law enforcement like investigation when you have a witness testify who's going to try and tell the truth as best they can there's going to be contradictions with other record evidence and the like and you start to generate and peers I mean the White House's story has fallen apart time and time again over the last week it started with oh this is all hearsay I didn't do it then it was oh the transcripts beautiful and perfect now the transcripts not so beautiful and perfect so every every new thing is actually so far Eastern in the cycle it's actually been at one that's hurt the president all I'm saying is it seems to me their motivation is to D legit amazed the investigation and not to cooperate in any way they should have tried that before it had nearly 60 percent public support the Miller investigation never had 60 percent of the American public eager to see the facts play on from them and to that point it's another call from inside the house as soon as we sat down New York Times breaking the news that Trump's Ukraine call was quote crazy and frightening that's according to an official that spoke to the whistleblower whose entire seven-page account has largely been corroborated by Donald Trump's own disclosures and confessions and that transcript that Donald Trump's White House released memorializing and corroborating the whistleblowers version of it let me read a little bit from this story by Nick fan des a White House official who listened to president Trump's July phone call with Ukraine's leader described it as quote crazy quote frightening and completely lacking in substance related to national security that's according to a memo written by the whistleblower at the center of the Ukraine scandal a CIA officer who spoke to the White House official the White House official was quoted ly shaken by what had transpired the CIA officer wrote in his memo one day after mr. Trump pressured President zalenski of Ukraine in a July 25th phone call to open investigations that would benefit him politically a palpable sense of concern had already taken hold among at least some in the White House but the call had veered well outside the bounds of traditional diplomacy the officer wrote I mean this is more corroborating evidence and this would indicate why the Trump appointed Inspector General of the intelligence community stamped this whistleblowers complaint as both credible and urgent once he started digging into the whistleblower sources sure after general is hearing from the men and women in the CIA or you know in the intelligence community who either heard the call or spoke to people who heard the call or saw a readout of the call and it is as they say in this article crazy and frightening yeah this is not the way diplomacy is conducted and while we do ask our allies for things in return for aid it's never personal political favors right we may Commission Aid on their advancing sons usually I'm like advancing democracy or giving women rights it's usually not dirty up Joe Biden's son exactly and so anybody who would have seen this or heard about it should have gone to the Inspector General with precisely this information this is troubling deeply so you know John this one you can't help but sort of recognize the patterns John Bolton resigned recently or left under under whatever version you choose to accept over the presidents you know alarming idea of having the Taliban at Camp David three days before the anniversary of 9/11 the the aides on the NSC staff I think it was HR McMaster and Deena Powell who were in the Oval when Russian diplomat Sergei Kiss lyac and Lavrov were in there talking about Comey being a nutjob and talking about having pressure relieved on them we're so alarmed by that call and and in their way of sort of pointing to Trump not disclosing intelligence was to suggest that they hadn't given it to him I mean this idea that that he's acting crazy and frightening with national security officials is the thread that runs through all of Trump's interactions with foreign leaders yeah and people inside the White House current and former had different reactions that's when you often asked on this show why did why do people stay right there are some people who do believe as this White House official told the whistleblower that the president's behavior was crazy and frightening and some people use that to justify staying that I can be a guardrail that I may not be able to change everything but I can be there to make sure that this one thing doesn't go off course or make sure it goes off course a little later than it would have otherwise and then there's people who at a certain point for whatever the issue is they they hit their limit and they leave and they say I cannot count into this and so I'm either leaving the White House I'm going into the private sector or I'm becoming a whistleblower I'm sharing information with the whistleblower but I do think that helps explain some of the behavior of current and former officials how they're reacting to an environment that they often at times find quite alarming oh it's going to say there's a little different or quite a difference between something that is crazy and frightening which this new New York Times story is about and something that's about personal presidential self-interest and subordinating American foreign policy one is one that maybe the voters voted for in 2016 know at some of the crayon display at every m√§ggerli exactly but the other this self-interest and done in secret Trump's plan was to do all of this with Ukraine and secret and indeed his Justice Department hid all this evidence from the people and it took this whistleblower to have it come out that's something that's fundamentally different that's what I think why the impeachment thing has such legs because that is really the textbook definition of what is an impeachable offense the president subordinating American foreign policy to his personal interests I think it also explains why former national security advisors are nowhere I mean if he were really innocent of anything that the whistleblower had attested to wouldn't HR McMaster show up somewhere saying I was on dozens hundreds of calls and meetings with Donald Trump before and leaders he would never do that when Dena Powell show up and say I was on dozens of call I mean wouldn't mattis come up and say for all that I saw and we disagreed on Syria policy which he went ahead and did anyway fine I mean not one person he's got Rudy Giuliani has come out and said Trump wouldn't do\n",

evidence that has emerged suggests that everyone that worked for him was operating as though there was absolutely a quid pro quo that both a visit to the White House and the release of the military it was absolutely tied to the Ukrainians enthusiasm and willingness and commitment in writing to investigating the Biden's so how do they feel like there are no quid pro quo defenses holding up there no quid pro quo defense seems to be that literally no one said hey let's do a quid pro quo but it at the diplomat who's said in writing that we got right who say who said he was worried that it seems like a quid pro quo and then the other diplomat said just to be clear this is calling on okay this this isn't a quid pro quo but there there were people it's Jonathan's point it's mixed because there are the president true lead when he released the transcript he truly did believe that it was a perfect call he did believe that it was totally appropriate and there were people inside the administration who even before they read the transcript or knew about it they they thought you know what I think the president's definition of perfect and totally appropriate is a little different than mine and is a little different than the public's and so they were they were worried about that going forward and so that's kind of the White House defense and then just to bring it to the Republicans briefly a lot of their defenses you see a lot of Republican lawmakers getting very squirrely when they're pressed on do you think this call was appropriate would you have asked for the same thing talking to the Ukrainian president but Republicans will sort of say I don't think this is impeachable they don't necessarily condone the content but they their sort of their argument is is both I believe he was joking and that I'm not prepared to say this is ideal but nor does it reach the level of impeachment so just one point I disagree with Neil on the Sunland on the way the way I was thinking about the sodden one thing I don't think they thought this guy was going to bring them down was going to come in and sort of be very damaging in his testimony in fact he is signaled that he's basically going to say very nice things then there obviously is the worry about the inconsistency in which you know he apparently told Johnson then so no doubt but the why it's much bigger than this the White House is going to put out probably pretty soon their legal guidance for how they're going to handle this thing which is basically to D legitimize the whole thing and they believe by sending anyone to the hill they give it some little bit of approval or legitimacy as much bigger they just want to say to hell with you guys we're not cooperating we're not getting involved in this and maybe there were people who were concerned about solar it's very possible about that one thing but it's much bigger it's they don't want to legitimize I just got the idea that Soglin was going to try and intend to be helpful he had million dollar man after all he donated million dollars to tracts inauguration but I think the problem in any law enforcement or law enforcement like investigation when you have a witness testify who's going to try and tell the truth as best they can there's going to be contradictions with other record evidence and the like and you start to generate and peers I mean the White House's story has fallen apart time and time again over the last week it started with oh this is all hearsay I didn't do it then it was oh the transcripts beautiful and perfect now the transcripts not so beautiful and perfect so every every new thing is actually so far Eastern in the cycle it's actually been at one that's hurt the president all I'm saying is it seems to me their motivation is to D legit amazed the investigation and not to cooperate in any way they should have tried that before it had nearly 60 percent public support the Miller investigation never had 60 percent of the American public eager to see the facts play on from them and to that point it's another call from inside the house as soon as we sat down New York Times breaking the news that Trump's Ukraine call was quote crazy and frightening that's according to an official that spoke to the whistleblower whose entire seven-page account has largely been corroborated by Donald Trump's own disclosures and confessions and that transcript that Donald Trump's White House released memorializing and corroborating the whistleblowers version of it let me read a little bit from this story by Nick fan des a White House official who listened to president Trump's July phone call with Ukraine's leader described it as quote crazy quote frightening and completely lacking in substance related to national security that's according to a memo written by the whistleblower at the center of the Ukraine scandal a CIA officer who spoke to the White House official the White House official was quoted ly shaken by what had transpired the CIA officer wrote in his memo one day after mr."

        "SENTENCE_TEXT" : "as they can't prove a quid pro quo I'm I'm fine I'm I'm free I that is that was it right that seems to be their public relations strategy if not their legal one all of the evidence that has emerged suggests that everyone that worked for him was operating as though there was absolutely a quid pro quo that both a visit to the White House and the release of the military it was absolutely tied to the Ukrainians enthusiasm and willingness and commitment in writing to investigating the Biden's so how do they feel like there are no quid pro quo defenses holding up there no quid pro quo defense seems to be that literally no one said hey let's do a quid pro quo but it at the diplomat who's said in writing that we got right who say who said he was worried that it seems like a quid pro quo and then the other diplomat said just to be clear this is calling on okay this this isn't a quid pro quo but there there were people it's Jonathan's point it's mixed because there are the president true lead when he released the transcript he truly did believe that it was a perfect call he did believe that it was totally appropriate and there were people inside the administration who even before they read the transcript or knew about it they they thought you know what I think the president's definition of perfect and totally appropriate is a little different than mine and is a little different than the public's and so they were they were worried about that going forward and so that's kind of the White House defense and then just to bring it to the Republicans briefly a lot of their defenses you see a lot of Republican lawmakers getting very squirrely when they're pressed on do you think this call was appropriate would you have asked for the same thing talking to the Ukrainian president but Republicans will sort of say I don't think this is impeachable they don't necessarily condone the content but they their sort of their argument is is both I believe he was joking and that I'm not prepared to say this is ideal but nor does it reach the level of impeachment so just one point I disagree with Neil on the Sunland on the way the way I was thinking about the sodden one thing I don't think they thought this guy was going to bring them down was going to come in and sort of be very damaging in his testimony in fact he is signaled that he's basically going to say very nice things then there obviously is the worry about the inconsistency in which you know he apparently told Johnson then so no doubt but the why it's much bigger than this the White House is going to put out probably pretty soon their legal guidance for how they're going to handle this thing which is basically to D legitimize the whole thing and they believe by sending anyone to the hill they give it some little bit of approval or legitimacy as much bigger they just want to say to hell with you guys we're not cooperating we're not getting involved in this and maybe there were people who were concerned about solar it's very possible about that one thing but it's much bigger it's they don't want to legitimize I just got the idea that Soglin was going to try and intend to be helpful he had million dollar man after all he donated million dollars to tracts inauguration but I think the problem in any law enforcement or law enforcement like investigation when you have a witness testify who's going to try and tell the truth as best they can there's going to be contradictions with other record evidence and the like and you start to generate and peers I mean the White House's story has fallen apart time and time again over the last week it started with oh this is all hearsay I didn't do it then it was oh the transcripts beautiful and perfect now the transcripts not so beautiful and perfect so every every new thing is actually so far Eastern in the cycle it's actually been at one that's hurt the president all I'm saying is it seems to me their motivation is to D legit amazed the investigation and not to cooperate in any way they should have tried that before it had nearly 60 percent public support the Miller investigation never had 60 percent of the American public eager to see the facts play on from them and to that point it's another call from inside the house as soon as we sat down New York Times breaking the news that Trump's Ukraine call was quote crazy and frightening that's according to an official that spoke to the whistleblower whose entire seven-page account has largely been corroborated by Donald Trump's own disclosures and confessions and that transcript that Donald Trump's White House released memorializing and corroborating the whistleblowers version of it let me read a little bit from this story by Nick fan des a White House official who listened to president Trump's July phone call with Ukraine's leader described it as quote crazy quote frightening and completely lacking in substance related to national security that's according to a memo written by the whistleblower at the center of the Ukraine scandal a CIA officer who spoke to the White House official the White House official was quoted ly shaken by what had transpired the CIA officer wrote in his memo one day after mr.",
