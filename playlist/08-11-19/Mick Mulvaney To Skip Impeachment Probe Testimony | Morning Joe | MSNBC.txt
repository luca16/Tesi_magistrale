that he also mentioned to me and past the the the the the corruption related to the DNC server absolutely no question about that but that's it that's why we held up the money now there was a report of the demand for an investigation into the Democrats was part of the reason that he it was on the to withhold funding to you from the look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation then that is absolutely rolled in the funded just described is a quid pro quo it is funding will not flow unless the investigation into the democratic server happened as well we do we do that all the time with foreign policy get over it there's going to be  political influence in foreign policy get over it said the act in White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney inside the White House briefing room just last month admitting president Trump withheld military aid in order to pressure Ukraine to conduct investigations into the Biden's and into a 2016 campaign conspiracy theory Mulvaney after hearing from the president later walked back those televised comments well we learned overnight that the House Intelligence Committee has subpoenaed Mulvaney to appear on Capitol Hill and to testify today this morning as part of the impeachment probe Mulvaney like several others in the Trump administration is  not expected to show up for that deposition let's bring a national political reporter for Axios Jonathan Swan Jonathan good morning so we just learned about this subpoena last night how did the Intel committee to decide to drop it so late and ask well they need to appear at nine o'clock this morning which you probably will not do well it's not designed to get him in this is just building a case for adding another article of impeachment around obstruction and of course Mick Mulvaney is not the first White House official to refuse to come and testify we've had his own aide Robb Blair we've had the National Security Council lawyers John Eisenberg and Michael Lewis as Michael Ellis we've had John Bolton so you know it's the exceptions that that go and testify like Tim Morrison over the objections of the White House Counsel they've been very clear about that so I see this is part of Adam Schiff building building an argument showing the defiance and then potentially adding another article of impeachment and what would Mick Mulvaney say when confronted with that videotape you admitted it on camera it's not a slip of the tongue it'd be interesting to hear him under sworn testimony explain what he meant by that comment and then later changing it I was listening to you earlier this morning Jonathan talking about how the White House is feeling about the way the impeachment inquiry is proceeding and what might happen when this if it gets to the Senate to those Republican jurors  listen to them one by one make up new excuses and new distractions for your president's behavior it doesn't look like Republicans are going to move off their votes in support of the  president Darren I mean you just have to accept reality for what it is they're in a very strong position the White House is not because of any grand strategy or four dimensional chess or war rooms or anything like that but simply because nothing has budged these senators nothing has moved them eager to sit a segment earlier on Jeff sessions which kind of says it all and and honestly I think the more like you  know we've been told you know who could the 20 be that defy him who quit the five be I think its scenario that we need to seriously consider is zero I think there is a not insignificant chance that zero Republican senators defect if nothing new comes out and we've got the current set of facts that we're dealing with I mean we interviewed Mitt Romney and he is supposedly the weakest brick in the in the red wall I mean he's not there yet I mean and just based on the interview we did with him if he's the weakest brick in that red wall it's a pretty strong wall over there in the Senate even though privately and his guy said who cares privately they all you know not all but a lot of them despise the president say that that you know they wish they could you know politically get away with replacing him with Mike Pence but none of that matters because when it comes down to it and when they have to do things in public and the vote they step in line you know Willie it really does come down to and and Donny I feel free to chime in here as well it really does come down to one thing his approval ratings that his approval ratings among Republicans but also these numbers that we've been showing that we're in the 30s now they're sitting at fifty fifty-one percent Americans supporting the impeachment and the removal of Donald Trump if those numbers go up to 55 60 percent that people after seeing the public testimony and I'm certainly not saying it is I'm just saying this is very very simple calculation we can't predict who's going to support him and who's not going to support him but I think we can say that if at the end of the testimony 60 percent of people in Colorado and Maine and in Arizona and in some of these states Nebraska in some of these states where candidates are in hiding Republican candidates are in hiding if 60 percent of the people in those states support impeachment and removal then of course you'll probably see a crack in that wall but as long as we're sitting at the numbers we're sitting at here it's probably not going to happen no I don't think so and it's Jonathan says the stories about senators quietly complaining about the prisoner getting exhausting and becoming thoroughly eye rolling that Donny they say if you took a secret ballot 35 Republicans would vote for impeachment but at this point not a single one of them would vote for it publicly yeah we'll go back to that manhood thing and I it's just everything I don't understand about psychology comes up here that the house how these men look at their families look at their children I think the important thing that the Democrats have to do going forward in this process because even if some of them do switch is still an insane long shot to think that 20 they're going to switch so we're going to be left in January where the House impeach them the Senate didn't throw them out and we're kind of just back to square one which is so important that they've got to frame these hearings in a bigger place so that you're still left with kitchen table issues so for instance if the whole thing is about extortion or betrayal or criminality you have to bring that back okay and he will extort your health care also or if it's about bright you know that'sthe important things that we're left with this is a halo effect it's not an isolated thing it's an indicative thing of how he cheats and steals and betrays you just like he betrayed you on our national security who will betray you on health care who will betray you on wages you have to set the stage you can't look at this the Democrats you've got to start framing this as an overall branding of Trump because in the end of the day we're gonna get back to where we started overall branding at least but there's a very specific charge here that's not hard to explain that the president used his political power withheld military aid for his personal benefit that shouldn't be that hard to understand abuse of power that needs to be the message over and over and over because that is very easy to understand yes only part that matters but it's abuse of power and the same way he's gonna take 20 million people's health insurance away abuse of power it's the same way he's gonna do another tax cut for the rich he betrayed you he's abusing the office so set the stage for the bigger cat kitchen table issues Jonathan Swan stay with us we've got some more to talk about with you still ahead we'll dig into the new
