 or damning evidence that the president tried extorting political dirt from a foreign leader by denying him desperately needed military aid in testimony released today by the House Intelligence Committee George Kent the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian affairs said it was made clear to him that the president wanted nothing less then president Solinsky to go to a microphone and say three things investigations Biden and Clinton Rory this week Gordon sunland testified that military aid approved by Congress would not be released until that message was delivered by by szalinski and now in an explosive report the New York Times reveals that president Olinsky was so desperate that he was prepared to deliver that message in an interview scheduled with CNN unwilling to lose the military aid he badly needed Solinsky decide to bow to trump's demands yet he was spared when the funds were mysteriously released this September Kent was so alarmed by the prospect of the United States requesting a politically motivated investigation that Heba moralized the conversations in a State Department memorandum expressing his concerns that it was injurious to the rule of law Ken will join him back there built our next week as the first witnesses when the Intelligence Committee of the house brings its impeachment inquiry out into the open with public hearings for more I'm John Miley Stewart and former aides of George W Bush in the White House there and in the State Department Shannon petty please and be seen as digital senior White House reporter in re Melbourne sticking with us MSNBC chief legal correspondent and host of the beat on MSNBC at least I want you to start here this guy now is laid it out the words were direct go to the nearest microphone and say what the president wants you to say that you have a conducting a national investigation by the Ukrainian government of the president's enemies in a way that one detail almost nails Trump more than anything simply because Donald Trump is so obsessed with television and doesn't seem like a national security official or anyone else would have come up with that exact idea as this has to be on TV it's made for TV those three words yeah I think all right thanks for sticking around you know I think that is a great image it's like the the the district attorney in some big town a big city the metropolis but I am going to bring charges uh and it gives us sort of a reality that would sit would endure all the way through next year's election II have always that picture to use of the top leader of a country saying we are now investigating just like in you know in a classic Big Town story bingo and and good to stick around and play hardball Chris you get me the pictures I'll get you the war you give me the pictures I'll get you the conspiracy theory the conspiracy theory I work for that company that was Hearst thank you I'm sorry oh yeah and and and the conspiracy theory in politics is you know Chris it doesn't have to be true it doesn't have to be half true it doesn't even have to be all that believable if there's smoke if there's pictures if there's enough to get it going as Elise said this has the fingerprints and and the the feel of a Donald Trump campaign because it's got to be public walked elector and got to be televised and that's why it's a mistreating of all of this to say oh was it true or not Donald Trump famously attacked all of his rivals in the primaries with nicknames with attacks went after Ted Cruz over a JFK conspiracy theory at no point was there a Wikipedia fact check right it's all about getting the smoke the fire the heat on the other people and this has those fingerprints and that's why this testimony that's adding up is damaging Chris because what we're seeing is more and more people who are on the inside who are in the room on the call dealing with the money and they're confirming not just one bad phone call not just one bad idea not just one request do me a favor they're confirming step by step by step the bribery conspiracy plot and in this case we're getting the news just today that the president of Ukraine was ready to take that next step in this conspiracy because he was so desperate to get those those javelin missiles theupset the Russian tanks coming in that was ready to walk up to that microphone he was gonna do it until he got the word dis September two months ago that they're gonna get the eight anyway so I didn't have to make an ass of himself he didn't have to do it but he was ready to do it right and that goes to look bribery quid pro quo is this for that it's bad to ever request any investigation into your rivals as an abuse of power legal scholars can disagree about whether that request alone becomes an impeachable high crime but I can tell you the Constitution doesn't answer that question on the nose Chris whereas once you get the quid pro quo is you just put it the investigation for the money hold up the money the New York Times report tonight saying because of the money they were gonna do it well now youhave the quid pro quo bribery and leave it to Donald Trump to find one of the only two offenses that's explicitly listed as impeachable in the Constitution one is treason the others bribery well are you a great journalist of every night I watch you you prove it you were right to go to law school become illegal it's become a criminal court anyway let's bring in former National Security Council senior director Ned Price Ned we're getting to this question now that not only was this president of a newly inaugurated president of Ukraine feeling the nerves feeling the pressure he was ready to walk up to that microphone and do exactly what from one of the do until he got the word serendipitously oh great I don't have to make a fool myself it's that we're getting the military aid yet Chris he was he was Saved by the Bell you know there there are very few comical elements of the transcript that was released today but one element that you can't just help but laugh at is is george canada's recounting how the ukrainians were somewhat perplexed about what exactly they were supposed to do they cited the fact that trump routinely called CNN fake news and so they thought that perhaps they shouldn't go on CNN but then they also saw a trump tweet where a president Trump hat was disparaging of Fox News and so for a while they were sort of in this position of well what do we do you guys told us to go out and to make this public we're willing to do it but how exactly do we do that you I think the broader point here though Chris is that every single one of the defenses the Trump administration has put forward from the fact that this was only about corruption from the idea that this was a means to get Europe to do its full share and finally bringing us to this other defense that you know what the aid actually flowed no harm no foul I think what was reported today really obliterates that argument because it shows that the Ukrainians knew that they were in a vise they knew what they were in a bind and they knew that they had to go out and publicly declare that they would undertake these politically motivated investigations or else this aid wouldn't flow it was only the clock that ran out if that had not happened I think we would have a very different ending to the story you know I think they should put the picture of this president next to the word extortion the next Webster's dictionary in his testimony George that released today George 10 describes his conversation with Lieutenant Colonel Alexander VIN men about Trump's call with the Ukrainian president according to Kent bitumens account was different than any readout call that I had received I could hear it in his voice and his hesitancy that he felt uncomfortable can adds that women would not share the majority of the call but did say that the conversation went into the direction of some of the most extreme narratives that have been discussed publicly Shannon it was worse than we can imagine it is the drug deal it is the smelly demand that a country under duress facing an existential challenge literally not the way it's used by the neo cons in this country but really was under one and and Trump was holding them up you know it's interesting that is a recurring theme you hear from people in the White House as crazy as it looks on the outside it is even more crazy on the inside is a motto I have heard through this whole administration so there are some very damaging stuff that came out in this transcript and the other transcripts and that will have the ability to be public testimony next week so the nightly news can get a soundbite and some of these things and print can now be brought to life on television but I do think there is a risk for Democrats here and at least this is what Republicans are hoping is that they will also get their public crack at these witnesses and that like we saw with the Muller testimony and with the Cavanaugh testimony having these public hearings might not go as well for the Democrats as they well if Republicans feel like they're able to chip away at these witnesses chip away at I need chip away at Taylor how did she wait this new guy came I mean we'll see they I mean look at how they went after kristinb lazy for trying to bring up things about how she had a fear of flying or whether not she did you know look at the way Lindsey Graham was able to grandstand in that hearing and have this sort of momenthey
