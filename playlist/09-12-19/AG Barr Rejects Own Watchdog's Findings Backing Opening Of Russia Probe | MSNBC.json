    "DOCUMENT" : "Julie Ainsley any reaction coming in for a William bar whose short legacy there so far really is taking the 23 month long Muller investigation pre spinning it spinning it as it came out and afterward being quite negative and derogatory about its findings strong reaction from the Attorney General Nicole I'm just reading this as it's coming in but he's already the Attorney General is already saying that this report really questions the legitimacy of the investigation which is not that the Inspector General Fatih support where does that come from from where I'll read you his words Nicole he says the elite doctor general's report now makes clear that the FBI launched an intrusive investigation of a u.s. presidential campaign on the thinnest of suspicions that in my view were insufficient to justify the steps taken that sentence alone shows you that the Attorney General is disagreeing with his Inspector General and the top line that we're all learning today which is that there was no evidence of political bias and opening this investigation and the only area where the collector General is questioning the mistakes that were made have to do with a FISA warrant that was not critical to the investigation in the first place so from the Attorney General coming in the first page of a report put out by his Justice Department says this the decision to open crossfire hurricane and for individual cases on current and former members of the Trump campaign George papadopolis Carter page Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn the early investigative steps taken and whether the openings and early steps complied with Department and FBI policies he finds no wrongdoing there I mean I guess what's so stunning is to stand in front of that building and read a statement from an attorney general refuting a document from his own Department what explains that Julia well you have to think about where the Attorney General stands now he has someone who just appointed John Durham the US attorney in Connecticut to do a criminal investigation into this very same matter Nicole so the Attorney General wants to look at what is being exposed today as something to justify that investigation and to try to you know kind of build a case for what he has said this is the same attorney in general who said that he believed there may have been spying on the Trump campaign that is not anywhere in this Inspector General report if I could I'd just like to read the next line of this too because he keeps making this case he says it is also clear that from its inception the investigation the evidence produced by the investigation was consistently exculpatory I think you could read at 430 pages of the Moller report to show that it was not all exculpatory evidence that there are a lot of very difficult legal decisions that were made along the way but this attorney general is making no lines blurred when it comes to how he views this inspector general report and how he viewed this entire investigation from the FBI through two molars conclusions help me understand this Frank the Attorney General disparages and does not believe in the robert muller investigation 23 months long guilty convictions guilty pleas by Mike Flynn by Paul Manafort by Roger stone the American attorney general does not believe his own departments Inspector General report I think if there's reason for concern today it's it's in sort of what is the evidence that he's looking at the facts well he's choosing to ignore the facts and what he's actually choosing to do is look at possible necessity of policy and procedure changes because I'm not in here to what I'm seeing here for example in the report is reference to the fact that wow the FBI actually doesn't have any written policy on investigating a president and his campaign so they went with the policy that they had and they complied with it they comported with existing policy so what I think you're going to hear is a steady drumbeat now is saying yeah the FBI's got a rewrite policy they shouldn't be looking at a campaign that's terribly intrusive well yeah it's intrusive but they followed the rules there was not misconduct in opening and conducting the cases in fact in one instance I'm reading here it finds that the FBI actually went above and beyond existing policies so for example apparently somebody wore a wire Suncoast operating source wore a wire against somebody in this investigation an FBI policy says a field supervisor can approve that it on a squad level they went all the way to the assistant director of counterintelligence to prove that wearing a wire so you're going to see evidence in here of extra rule-following but you're going to see the White House in the AG say I don't like the policy of this I don't like the smell of investigating a campaign and I'll ask him this would you have liked it if it was Obama being investigated or do you not like the policy because it's your guy being and I just you know I guess I'm old enough to remember the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails and I don't remember a single Republican ever going on the record and saying they didn't support the idea of investigating a person running for president so again it's it's it's certainly a legitimate debate to have as a country how do you investigate a campaign where there's suspicion of wrongdoing but it's just mind boggling that this is the second years long investigation into the president's campaign that bar doesn't believe well I understood Julia Ainsley just say that the Attorney General characterized the standard as insufficient in my view so to Frank's point it's not that they didn't comply with their guidelines it sounds more like the Attorney General just doesn't like the guidelines with which they complied did he complain about them when they were applied to the Hillary Clinton County I don't know him to have ever complained but this is a really important point let me just read from the report the FBI has something called a domestic investigations Operations guide that is one of the two main documents that tells the FBI what it can do and when it can do it they also have attorney general guidelines that have the same purpose using those two documents together the FBI is instructed on the propriety of investigating and opening investigations at certain times the standard is purposefully low with in other words the threshold the operations guidelines provides for two types of investigations preliminary and full a preliminary investigation may be open based upon quote any allegation or information end quote indicative a possible criminal activity or threats to the national security it's purposefully set low why is it purposefully set low because you can't investigate a case before you investigate a case you open the case I should better state it you can't know the results of an investigation before you open the investigation you set the threshold low you use all the lawful tools at your disposal and then you make a determination whether or not you can charge someone with a crime or you have some counterintelligence matter that you have to act upon it set low for a purpose the Attorney General apparently doesn't like that he has the authority to change it but you can't criticize the FBI for following its guidelines apparently again if your attorney and faithfully and honestly criticize the FBI for following its guidelines hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to

is that there was no evidence of political bias and opening this investigation and the only area where the collector General is questioning the mistakes that were made have to do with a FISA warrant that was not critical to the investigation in the first place so from the Attorney General coming in the first page of a report put out by his Justice Department says this the decision to open

whether the openings and early steps complied with Department and FBI policies he finds no wrongdoing there I mean I guess what's so stunning is to stand in front of that building and read a statement

Durham the US attorney in Connecticut to do a criminal investigation into this very same matter Nicole so the Attorney General wants to look at what is being exposed today as something to justify that investigation and to try to you know kind of build a case for what he has said this is the same attorney in general who said that he believed there may have been spying on the Trump campaign that is not anywhere in this Inspector General report if I could I'd just like to read the next line of this too because he keeps making this case he says it is also clear that from its inception the investigation the evidence produced by the investigation was consistently exculpatory I think you could read at 430 pages of the Moller report to show that it was not all exculpatory evidence that there are a lot of very difficult legal decisions that were made along the way but this attorney general is making no lines blurred when it comes to how he views this inspector general report and how he viewed this entire investigation from the FBI through two molars conclusions help me understand this Frank the Attorney General disparages and does not believe in the robert muller investigation 23 months long guilty convictions guilty pleas by Mike Flynn by Paul Manafort by Roger stone the American attorney general does not believe his own departments Inspector General report I think if there's reason for concern today it's it's in sort of what is the evidence that he's looking at the facts well he's choosing to ignore the facts and what he's actually choosing to do is look at possible necessity of policy and procedure changes because I'm not in here to what I'm seeing here for example in the report is reference to the fact that wow the FBI actually doesn't have any written policy on investigating a president and his campaign so they went with the policy that they had and they complied with it they comported with existing policy so what I think you're going to hear is a steady drumbeat now is saying yeah the FBI's got a rewrite policy they shouldn't be looking at a campaign that's terribly intrusive well yeah it's intrusive but they followed the rules there was not misconduct in opening and conducting the cases in fact in one instance I'm reading here it finds that the FBI actually went above and beyond existing policies so for example apparently somebody wore a wire Suncoast operating source wore a wire against somebody in this investigation an FBI policy says a field supervisor can approve that it on a squad level they went all the way to the assistant director of counterintelligence to prove that wearing a wire so you're going to see evidence in here of extra rule-following but you're going to see the White House in the AG say I don't like the policy of this I don't like the smell of investigating a campaign and I'll ask him this would you have liked it if it was Obama being investigated or do you not like the policy because it's your guy being and I just you know I guess I'm old enough to remember the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails and I don't remember a single Republican ever going on the record and saying they didn't support the idea of investigating a person running for president so again it's it's it's certainly a legitimate debate to have as a country how do you investigate a campaign where there's suspicion of wrongdoing but it's just mind boggling that this is the second years long investigation into the president's campaign that bar doesn't believe well I understood Julia Ainsley just say that the Attorney General characterized the standard as insufficient in my view so to Frank's point it's not that they didn't comply with their guidelines it sounds more like the Attorney General just doesn't like the guidelines with which they complied did he complain about them when they were applied to the Hillary Clinton County I don't know him to have ever complained but this is a really important point let me just read from the report the FBI has something called a domestic investigations Operations guide that is one of the two main documents that tells the FBI what it can do and when it can do it they also have attorney general guidelines that have the same purpose using those two documents together the FBI is instructed on the propriety of investigating and opening investigations at certain times the standard is purposefully low with in other words the threshold the operations guidelines provides for two types of investigations preliminary and full a preliminary investigation may be open based upon quote any allegation or information end quote indicative a possible criminal activity or threats to the national security it's purposefully set low why is it purposefully set low because you can't investigate a case before you investigate a case you open the case I should better state it you can't know the results of an investigation before you open the investigation you set the threshold low you use all the lawful tools at your disposal and then you make a determination whether or not you can charge someone with a crime or you have some counterintelligence matter that you have to act upon it set low for a purpose the Attorney General apparently doesn't like that he has the authority to change it but you can't criticize the FBI for following its guidelines

drumbeat now is saying yeah the FBI's got a rewrite policy they shouldn't be looking at a campaign that's terribly intrusive well yeah it's intrusive but they followed the rules there was not

do it they also have attorney general guidelines that have the same purpose using those two documents together the FBI is instructed on the propriety of investigating and opening investigations at certain times the standard is purposefully low with in other words the threshold the operations guidelines provides for two types of investigations preliminary and full a preliminary investigation may be open based upon quote any allegation or information end quote indicative a possible criminal activity or threats to the national security it's purposefully set low why is it purposefully set low because you can't investigate a case before you investigate a case you open the case I should better state it you can't know the results of an investigation before you open the investigation you set the threshold low you use all the lawful tools at your disposal and then you make a determination whether or not you can charge someone with a crime or you have some counterintelligence matter that you have to act upon it set low for a purpose the Attorney General apparently doesn't like that he has the authority to change it but you can't criticize the FBI for following its guidelines

there are a lot of very difficult legal decisions that were made along the way but this attorney general is making no lines blurred when it comes to how he views this inspector general report and how

months long guilty convictions guilty pleas by Mike Flynn by Paul Manafort by Roger stone the American attorney general does not believe his own departments Inspector General report I think if there's reason for concern today it's it's in sort of what is the evidence that he's looking at the facts well he's choosing to ignore the facts and what he's actually choosing to do is look at possible necessity of policy and procedure changes because I'm not in here to what I'm seeing here for example in the report is reference to the fact that wow the FBI actually doesn't have any written policy on investigating a president and his campaign so they went with the policy that they had and they complied with it they comported with existing policy so what I think you're going to hear is a steady drumbeat now is saying yeah the FBI's got a rewrite policy they shouldn't be looking at a campaign that's terribly intrusive well yeah it's intrusive but they followed the rules there was not misconduct in opening and conducting the cases in fact in one instance I'm reading here it finds that the FBI actually went above and beyond existing policies so for example apparently somebody wore a wire Suncoast operating source wore a wire against somebody in this investigation an FBI policy says a field supervisor can approve that it on a squad level they went all the way to the assistant director of counterintelligence to prove that wearing a wire so you're going to see evidence in here of extra rule-following but you're going to see the White House in the AG say I don't like the policy of this I don't like the smell of investigating a campaign and I'll ask him this would you have liked it if it was Obama being investigated or do you not like the policy because it's your guy being and I just you know I guess I'm old enough to remember the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails and I don't remember a single Republican ever going on the record and saying they didn't support the idea of investigating a person running for president so again it's it's it's certainly a legitimate debate to have as a country how do you investigate a campaign where there's suspicion of wrongdoing but it's just mind boggling that this is the second years long investigation into the president's campaign that bar doesn't believe well I understood Julia Ainsley just say that the

like the guidelines with which they complied did he complain about them when they were applied to the Hillary Clinton County I don't know him to have ever complained but this is a really important point let me just read from the report the FBI has something called a domestic investigations Operations guide that is one of the two main documents that tells the FBI what it can do and when it can do it they also have attorney general guidelines that have the same purpose using those two documents together the FBI is instructed on the propriety of investigating and opening investigations at certain times the standard is purposefully low with in other words the threshold the operations guidelines provides for two types of investigations preliminary and full a preliminary investigation may be open based upon quote any allegation or information end quote indicative a possible criminal activity or threats to the national security it's purposefully set low why is it purposefully set low because you can't investigate a case before you investigate a case you open the case I should better state it you can't know the results of an investigation before you open the investigation you set the threshold low you use all the lawful tools at your disposal and then you make a determination whether or not you can charge someone with a crime or you have some counterintelligence matter that you have to act upon it set low for a purpose the Attorney General apparently doesn't like that he has the authority to change it but you can't criticize the FBI for following its guidelines

investigation and to try to you know kind of build a case for what he has said this is the same attorney in general who said that he believed there may have been spying on the Trump campaign that is not anywhere in this Inspector General report if I could I'd just like to read the next line of this too because he keeps making this case he says it is also clear that from its inception the investigation the evidence produced by the investigation was consistently exculpatory I think you could read at 430 pages of the Moller report to show that it was not all exculpatory evidence that there are a lot of very difficult legal decisions that were made along the way but this attorney general is making no lines blurred when it comes to how he views this inspector general report and how he viewed this entire investigation from the FBI through two molars conclusions help me understand this Frank the Attorney General disparages and does not believe in the robert muller investigation 23 months long guilty convictions guilty pleas by Mike Flynn by Paul Manafort by Roger stone the American attorney general does not believe his own departments Inspector General report I think if there's reason for concern today it's it's in sort of what is the evidence that he's looking at the facts well he's choosing to ignore the facts and what he's actually choosing to do is look at possible necessity of policy and procedure changes because I'm not in here to what I'm seeing here for example in the report is reference to the fact that wow the FBI actually doesn't have any written policy on investigating a president and his campaign so they went with the policy that they had and they complied with it they comported with existing policy so what I think you're going to hear is a steady drumbeat now is saying yeah the FBI's got a rewrite policy they shouldn't be looking at a campaign that's terribly intrusive well yeah it's intrusive but they followed the rules there was not misconduct in opening and conducting the cases in fact in one instance I'm reading here it finds that the FBI actually went above and beyond existing policies so for example apparently somebody wore a wire Suncoast operating source wore a wire against somebody in this investigation an FBI policy says a field supervisor can approve that it on a squad level they went all the way to the assistant director of counterintelligence to prove that wearing a wire so you're going to see evidence in here of extra rule-following but you're going to see the White House in the AG say I don't like the policy of this I don't like the smell of investigating a campaign and I'll ask him this would you have liked it if it was Obama being investigated or do you not like the policy because it's your guy being and I just you know I guess I'm old enough to remember the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails and I don't remember a single Republican ever going on the record and saying they didn't support the idea of investigating a person running for president so again it's it's it's certainly a legitimate debate to have as a country how do you investigate a campaign where there's suspicion of

point let me just read from the report the FBI has something called a domestic investigations Operations guide that is one of the two main documents that tells the FBI what it can do and when it can do it they also have attorney general guidelines that have the same purpose using those two documents together the FBI is instructed on the propriety of investigating and opening investigations at certain times the standard is purposefully low with in other words the threshold the operations guidelines provides for two types of investigations preliminary and full a preliminary investigation may be open based upon quote any allegation or information end quote indicative a possible criminal activity or threats to the national security it's purposefully set low why is it purposefully set low because you can't investigate a case before you investigate a case you open the case I should better state it you can't know the results of an investigation before you open the investigation you set the threshold low you use all the lawful tools at your disposal and then you make a determination whether or not you can charge someone with a crime or you have some counterintelligence matter that you have to act upon it set low for a purpose the Attorney General apparently doesn't like that he has the authority to change it but you can't criticize the FBI for following its guidelines

is that there was no evidence of political bias and opening this investigation and the only area where the collector General is questioning the mistakes that were made have to do with a FISA warrant that was not critical to the investigation in the first place so from the Attorney General coming in the first page of a report put out by his Justice Department says this the decision to open crossfire hurricane and for individual cases on current and former members of the Trump campaign George papadopolis Carter page Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn the early investigative steps taken and whether the openings and early steps complied with Department and FBI policies he finds no wrongdoing there I mean I guess what's so stunning is to stand in front of that building and read a statement from an attorney general refuting a document from his own Department what explains that Julia well you have to think about where the Attorney General stands now he has someone who just appointed John Durham the US attorney in Connecticut to do a criminal investigation into this very same matter Nicole so the Attorney General wants to look at what is being exposed today as something to justify that investigation and to try to you know kind of build a case for what he has said this is the same attorney in general who said that he believed there may have been spying on the Trump campaign that is not anywhere in this Inspector General report if I could I'd just like to read the next line of this too because he keeps making this case he says it is also clear that from its inception the investigation the evidence produced by the investigation was consistently exculpatory I think you could read at 430 pages of the Moller report to show that it was not all exculpatory evidence that there are a lot of very difficult legal decisions that were made along the way but this attorney general is making no lines blurred when it comes to how he views this inspector general report and how he viewed this entire investigation from the FBI through two molars conclusions help me understand this Frank the Attorney General disparages and does not believe in the robert muller investigation 23 months long guilty convictions guilty pleas by Mike Flynn by Paul Manafort by Roger stone the American attorney general does not believe his own departments Inspector General report I think if there's reason for concern today it's it's in sort of what is the evidence that he's looking at the facts well he's choosing to ignore the facts and what he's actually choosing to do is look at possible necessity of policy and procedure changes because I'm not in here to what I'm seeing here for example in the report is reference to the fact that wow the FBI actually doesn't have any written policy on investigating a president and his campaign so they went with the policy that they had and they complied with it they comported with existing policy so what I think you're going to hear is a steady drumbeat now is saying yeah the FBI's got a rewrite policy they shouldn't be looking at a campaign that's terribly intrusive well yeah it's intrusive but they followed the rules there was not misconduct in opening and conducting the cases in fact in one instance I'm reading here it finds that the FBI actually went above and beyond existing policies so for example apparently somebody wore a wire Suncoast operating source wore a wire against somebody in this investigation an FBI policy says a field supervisor can approve that it on a squad level they went all the way to the assistant director of counterintelligence to prove that wearing a wire so you're going to see evidence in here of extra rule-following but you're going to see the White House in the AG say I don't like the policy of this I don't like the smell of investigating a campaign and I'll ask him this would you have liked it if it was Obama being investigated or do you not like the policy because it's your guy being and I just you know I guess I'm old enough to remember the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails and I don't remember a single Republican ever going on the record and saying they didn't support the idea of investigating a person running for president so again it's it's it's certainly a legitimate debate to have as a country how do you investigate a campaign where there's suspicion of wrongdoing but it's just mind boggling that this is the second years long investigation into the president's campaign that bar doesn't believe well I understood Julia Ainsley just say that the Attorney General characterized the standard as insufficient in my view so to Frank's point it's not that they didn't comply with their guidelines it sounds more like the Attorney General just doesn't like the guidelines with which they complied did he complain about them when they were applied to the Hillary Clinton County I don't know him to have ever complained but this is a really important point let me just read from the report the FBI has something called a domestic investigations Operations guide that is one of the two main documents that tells the FBI what it can do and when it can do it they also have attorney general guidelines that have the same purpose using those two documents together the FBI is instructed on the propriety of investigating and opening investigations at certain times the standard is purposefully low with in other words the threshold the operations guidelines provides for two types of investigations preliminary and full a preliminary investigation may be open based upon quote any allegation or information end quote indicative a possible criminal activity or threats to the national security it's purposefully set low why is it purposefully set low because you can't investigate a case before you investigate a case you open the case I should better state it you can't know the results of an investigation before you open the investigation you set the threshold low you use all the lawful tools at your disposal and then you make a determination whether or not you can charge someone with a crime or you have some counterintelligence matter that you have to act upon it set low for a purpose the Attorney General apparently doesn't like that he has the authority to change it but you can't criticize the FBI for following its guidelines

is that there was no evidence of political bias and opening this investigation and the only area where the collector General is questioning the mistakes that were made have to do with a FISA warrant that was not critical to the investigation in the first place so from the Attorney General coming in the first page of a report put out by his Justice Department says this the decision to open crossfire hurricane and for individual cases on current and former members of the Trump campaign George papadopolis Carter page Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn the early investigative steps taken and whether the openings and early steps complied with Department and FBI policies he finds no wrongdoing there I mean I guess what's so stunning is to stand in front of that building and read a statement from an attorney general refuting a document from his own Department what explains that Julia well you have to think about where the Attorney General stands now he has someone who just appointed John Durham the US attorney in Connecticut to do a criminal investigation into this very same matter Nicole so the Attorney General wants to look at what is being exposed today as something to justify that investigation and to try to you know kind of build a case for what he has said this is the same attorney in general who said that he believed there may have been spying on the Trump campaign that is not anywhere in this Inspector General report if I could I'd just like to read the next line of this too because he keeps making this case he says it is also clear that from its inception the investigation the evidence produced by the investigation was consistently exculpatory I think you could read at 430 pages of the Moller report to show that it was not all exculpatory evidence that there are a lot of very difficult legal decisions that were made along the way but this attorney general is making no lines blurred when it comes to how he views this inspector general report and how he viewed this entire investigation from the FBI through two molars conclusions help me understand this Frank the Attorney General disparages and does not believe in the robert muller investigation 23 months long guilty convictions guilty pleas by Mike Flynn by Paul Manafort by Roger stone the American attorney general does not believe his own departments Inspector General report I think if there's reason for concern today it's it's in sort of what is the evidence that he's looking at the facts well he's choosing to ignore the facts and what he's actually choosing to do is look at possible necessity of policy and procedure changes because I'm not in here to what I'm seeing here for example in the report is reference to the fact that wow the FBI actually doesn't have any written policy on investigating a president and his campaign so they went with the policy that they had and they complied with it they comported with existing policy so what I think you're going to hear is a steady drumbeat now is saying yeah the FBI's got a rewrite policy they shouldn't be looking at a campaign that's terribly intrusive well yeah it's intrusive but they followed the rules there was not misconduct in opening and conducting the cases in fact in one instance I'm reading here it finds that the FBI actually went above and beyond existing policies so for example apparently somebody wore a wire Suncoast operating source wore a wire against somebody in this investigation an FBI policy says a field supervisor can approve that it on a squad level they went all the way to the assistant director of counterintelligence to prove that wearing a wire so you're going to see evidence in here of extra rule-following but you're going to see the White House in the AG say I don't like the policy of this I don't like the smell of investigating a campaign and I'll ask him this would you have liked it if it was Obama being investigated or do you not like the policy because it's your guy being and I just you know I guess I'm old enough to remember the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails and I don't remember a single Republican ever going on the record and saying they didn't support the idea of investigating a person running for president so again it's it's it's certainly a legitimate debate to have as a country how do you investigate a campaign where there's suspicion of wrongdoing but it's just mind boggling that this is the second years long investigation into the president's campaign that bar doesn't believe well I understood Julia Ainsley just say that the

like the guidelines with which they complied did he complain about them when they were applied to the Hillary Clinton County I don't know him to have ever complained but this is a really important point let me just read from the report the FBI has something called a domestic investigations Operations guide that is one of the two main documents that tells the FBI what it can do and when it can do it they also have attorney general guidelines that have the same purpose using those two documents together the FBI is instructed on the propriety of investigating and opening investigations at certain times the standard is purposefully low with in other words the threshold the operations guidelines provides for two types of investigations preliminary and full a preliminary investigation may be open based upon quote any allegation or information end quote indicative a possible criminal activity or threats to the national security it's purposefully set low why is it purposefully set low because you can't investigate a case before you investigate a case you open the case I should better state it you can't know the results of an investigation before you open the investigation you set the threshold low you use all the lawful tools at your disposal and then you make a determination whether or not you can charge someone with a crime or you have some counterintelligence matter that you have to act upon it set low for a purpose the Attorney General apparently doesn't like that he has the authority to change it but you can't criticize the FBI for following its guidelines

General is already saying that this report really questions the legitimacy of the investigation which is not that the Inspector General Fatih support where does that come from from where I'll read you his words Nicole he says the elite doctor general's report now makes clear that the FBI launched an intrusive investigation of a u.s. presidential campaign on the thinnest of suspicions that in my view were insufficient to justify the steps taken that sentence alone shows you that the Attorney General is disagreeing with his Inspector General and the top line that we're all learning today which is that there was no evidence of political bias and opening this investigation and the only area where the collector General is questioning the mistakes that were made have to do with a FISA warrant that was not critical to the investigation in the first place so from the Attorney General coming in the first page of a report put out by his Justice Department says this the decision to open crossfire hurricane and for individual cases on current and former members of the Trump campaign George papadopolis Carter page Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn the early investigative steps taken and whether the openings and early steps complied with Department and FBI policies he finds no wrongdoing there I mean I guess what's so stunning is to stand in front of that building and read a statement from an attorney general refuting a document from his own Department what explains that Julia well you have to think about where the Attorney General stands now he has someone who just appointed John Durham the US attorney in Connecticut to do a criminal investigation into this very same matter Nicole so the Attorney General wants to look at what is being exposed today as something to justify that investigation and to try to you know kind of build a case for what he has said this is the same attorney in general who said that he believed there may have been spying on the Trump campaign that is not anywhere in this Inspector General report if I could I'd just like to read the next line of this too because he keeps making this case he says it is also clear that from its inception the investigation the evidence produced by the investigation was consistently exculpatory I think you could read at 430 pages of the Moller report to show that it was not all exculpatory evidence that there are a lot of very difficult legal decisions that were made along the way but this attorney general is making no lines blurred when it comes to how he views this inspector general report and how he viewed this entire investigation from the FBI through two molars conclusions help me understand this Frank the Attorney General disparages and does not believe in the robert muller investigation 23 months long guilty convictions guilty pleas by Mike Flynn by Paul Manafort by Roger stone the American attorney general does not believe his own departments Inspector General report I think if there's reason for concern today it's it's in sort of what is the evidence that he's looking at the facts well he's choosing to ignore the facts and what he's actually choosing to do is look at possible necessity of policy and procedure changes because I'm not in here to what I'm seeing here for example in the report is reference to the fact that wow the FBI actually doesn't have any written policy on investigating a president and his campaign so they went with the policy that they had and they complied with it they comported with existing policy so what I think you're going to hear is a steady drumbeat now is saying yeah the FBI's got a rewrite policy they shouldn't be looking at a campaign that's terribly intrusive well yeah it's intrusive but they followed the rules there was not misconduct in opening and conducting the cases in fact in one instance I'm reading here it finds that the FBI actually went above and beyond existing policies so for example apparently somebody wore a wire Suncoast operating source wore a wire against somebody in this investigation an FBI policy says a field supervisor can approve that it on a squad level they went all the way to the assistant director of counterintelligence to prove that wearing a wire so you're going to see evidence in here of extra rule-following but you're going to see the White House in the AG say I don't like the policy of this I don't like the smell of investigating a campaign and I'll ask him this would you have liked it if it was Obama being investigated or do you not like the policy because it's your guy being and I just you know I guess I'm old enough to remember the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails and I don't remember a single Republican ever going on the record and saying they didn't support the idea of investigating a person running for president so again it's it's it's certainly a legitimate debate to have as a country how do you investigate a campaign where there's suspicion of wrongdoing but it's just mind boggling that this is the second years long investigation into the president's campaign that bar doesn't believe well I understood Julia Ainsley just say that the Attorney General characterized the standard as insufficient in my view so to Frank's point it's not that they didn't comply with their guidelines it sounds more like the Attorney General just doesn't like the guidelines with which they complied did he complain about them when they were applied to the Hillary Clinton County I don't know him to have ever complained but this is a really important point let me just read from the report the FBI has something called a domestic investigations Operations guide that is one of the two main documents that tells the FBI what it can do and when it can do it they also have attorney general guidelines that have the same purpose using those two documents together the FBI is instructed on the propriety of investigating and opening investigations at certain times the standard is purposefully low with in other words the threshold the operations guidelines provides for two types of investigations preliminary and full a preliminary investigation may be open based upon quote any allegation or information end quote indicative a possible criminal activity or threats to the national security it's purposefully set low why is it purposefully set low because you can't investigate a case before you investigate a case you open the case I should better state it you can't know the results of an investigation before you open the investigation you set the threshold low you use all the lawful tools at your disposal and then you make a determination whether or not you can charge someone with a crime or you have some counterintelligence matter that you have to act upon it set low for a purpose the Attorney General apparently doesn't like that he has the authority to change it but you can't criticize the FBI for following its guidelines

whether the openings and early steps complied with Department and FBI policies he finds no wrongdoing there I mean I guess what's so stunning is to stand in front of that building and read a statement from an attorney general refuting a document from his own Department what explains that Julia well you have to think about where the Attorney General stands now he has someone who just appointed John Durham the US attorney in Connecticut to do a criminal investigation into this very same matter Nicole so the Attorney General wants to look at what is being exposed today as something to justify that investigation and to try to you know kind of build a case for what he has said this is the same attorney in general who said that he believed there may have been spying on the Trump campaign that is not anywhere in this Inspector General report if I could I'd just like to read the next line of this too because he keeps making this case he says it is also clear that from its inception the investigation the evidence produced by the investigation was consistently exculpatory I think you could read at 430 pages of the Moller report to show that it was not all exculpatory evidence that there are a lot of very difficult legal decisions that were made along the way but this attorney general is making no lines blurred when it comes to how he views this inspector general report and how he viewed this entire investigation from the FBI through two molars conclusions help me understand this Frank the Attorney General disparages and does not believe in the robert muller investigation 23 months long guilty convictions guilty pleas by Mike Flynn by Paul Manafort by Roger stone the American attorney general does not believe his own departments Inspector General report I think if there's reason for concern today it's it's in sort of what is the evidence that he's looking at the facts well he's choosing to ignore the facts and what he's actually choosing to do is look at possible necessity of policy and procedure changes because I'm not in here to what I'm seeing here for example in the report is reference to the fact that wow the FBI actually doesn't have any written policy on investigating a president and his campaign so they went with the policy that they had and they complied with it they comported with existing policy so what I think you're going to hear is a steady drumbeat now is saying yeah the FBI's got a rewrite policy they shouldn't be looking at a campaign that's terribly intrusive well yeah it's intrusive but they followed the rules there was not misconduct in opening and conducting the cases in fact in one instance I'm reading here it finds that the FBI actually went above and beyond existing policies so for example apparently somebody wore a wire Suncoast operating source wore a wire against somebody in this investigation an FBI policy says a field supervisor can approve that it on a squad level they went all the way to the assistant director of counterintelligence to prove that wearing a wire so you're going to see evidence in here of extra rule-following but you're going to see the White House in the AG say I don't like the policy of this I don't like the smell of investigating a campaign and I'll ask him this would you have liked it if it was Obama being investigated or do you not like the policy because it's your guy being and I just you know I guess I'm old enough to remember the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails and I don't remember a single Republican ever going on the record and saying they didn't support the idea of investigating a person running for president so again it's it's it's certainly a legitimate debate to have as a country how do you investigate a campaign where there's suspicion of wrongdoing but it's just mind boggling that this is the second years long investigation into the president's campaign that bar doesn't believe well I understood Julia Ainsley just say that the Attorney General characterized the standard as insufficient in my view so to Frank's point it's not that they didn't comply with their guidelines it sounds more like the Attorney General just doesn't like the guidelines with which they complied did he complain about them when they were applied to the Hillary Clinton County I don't know him to have ever complained but this is a really important point let me just read from the report the FBI has something called a domestic investigations Operations guide that is one of the two main documents that tells the FBI what it can do and when it can do it they also have attorney general guidelines that have the same purpose using those two documents together the FBI is instructed on the propriety of investigating and opening investigations at certain times the standard is purposefully low with in other words the threshold the operations guidelines provides for two types of investigations preliminary and full a preliminary investigation may be open based upon quote any allegation or information end quote indicative a possible criminal activity or threats to the national security it's purposefully set low why is it purposefully set low because you can't investigate a case before you investigate a case you open the case I should better state it you can't know the results of an investigation before you open the investigation you set the threshold low you use all the lawful tools at your disposal and then you make a determination whether or not you can charge someone with a crime or you have some counterintelligence matter that you have to act upon it set low for a purpose the Attorney General apparently doesn't like that he has the authority to change it but you can't criticize the FBI for following its guidelines

whether the openings and early steps complied with Department and FBI policies he finds no wrongdoing there I mean I guess what's so stunning is to stand in front of that building and read a statement from an attorney general refuting a document from his own Department what explains that Julia well you have to think about where the Attorney General stands now he has someone who just appointed John Durham the US attorney in Connecticut to do a criminal investigation into this very same matter Nicole so the Attorney General wants to look at what is being exposed today as something to justify that investigation and to try to you know kind of build a case for what he has said this is the same attorney in general who said that he believed there may have been spying on the Trump campaign that is not anywhere in this Inspector General report if I could I'd just like to read the next line of this too because he keeps making this case he says it is also clear that from its inception the investigation the evidence produced by the investigation was consistently exculpatory I think you could read at 430 pages of the Moller report to show that it was not all exculpatory evidence that there are a lot of very difficult legal decisions that were made along the way but this attorney general is making no lines blurred when it comes to how he views this inspector general report and how he viewed this entire investigation from the FBI through two molars conclusions help me understand this Frank the Attorney General disparages and does not believe in the robert muller investigation 23 months long guilty convictions guilty pleas by Mike Flynn by Paul Manafort by Roger stone the American attorney general does not believe his own departments Inspector General report I think if there's reason for concern today it's it's in sort of what is the evidence that he's looking at the facts well he's choosing to ignore the facts and what he's actually choosing to do is look at possible necessity of policy and procedure changes because I'm not in here to what I'm seeing here for example in the report is reference to the fact that wow the FBI actually doesn't have any written policy on investigating a president and his campaign so they went with the policy that they had and they complied with it they comported with existing policy so what I think you're going to hear is a steady drumbeat now is saying yeah the FBI's got a rewrite policy they shouldn't be looking at a campaign that's terribly intrusive well yeah it's intrusive but they followed the rules there was not misconduct in opening and conducting the cases in fact in one instance I'm reading here it finds that the FBI actually went above and beyond existing policies so for example apparently somebody wore a wire Suncoast operating source wore a wire against somebody in this investigation an FBI policy says a field supervisor can approve that it on a squad level they went all the way to the assistant director of counterintelligence to prove that wearing a wire so you're going to see evidence in here of extra rule-following but you're going to see the White House in the AG say I don't like the policy of this I don't like the smell of investigating a campaign and I'll ask him this would you have liked it if it was Obama being investigated or do you not like the policy because it's your guy being and I just you know I guess I'm old enough to remember the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails and I don't remember a single Republican ever going on the record and saying they didn't support the idea of investigating a person running for president so again it's it's it's certainly a legitimate debate to have as a country how do you investigate a campaign where there's suspicion of wrongdoing but it's just mind boggling that this is the second years long investigation into the president's campaign that bar doesn't believe well I understood Julia Ainsley just say that the Attorney General characterized the standard as insufficient in my view so to Frank's point it's not that they didn't comply with their guidelines it sounds more like the Attorney General just doesn't like the guidelines with which they complied did he complain about them when they were applied to the Hillary Clinton County I don't know him to have ever complained but this is a really important point let me just read from the report the FBI has something called a domestic investigations Operations guide that is one of the two main documents that tells the FBI what it can do and when it can do it they also have attorney general guidelines that have the same purpose using those two documents together the FBI is instructed on the propriety of investigating and opening investigations at certain times the standard is purposefully low with in other words the threshold the operations guidelines provides for two types of investigations preliminary and full a preliminary investigation may be open based upon quote any allegation or information end quote indicative a possible criminal activity or threats to the national security it's purposefully set low why is it purposefully set low because you can't investigate a case before you investigate a case you open the case I should better state it you can't know the results of an investigation before you open the investigation you set the threshold low you use all the lawful tools at your disposal and then you make a determination whether or not you can charge someone with a crime or you have some counterintelligence matter that you have to act upon it set low for a purpose the Attorney General apparently doesn't like that he has the authority to change it but you can't criticize the FBI for following its guidelines

on investigating a president and his campaign so they went with the policy that they had and they complied with it they comported with existing policy so what I think you're going to hear is a steady drumbeat now is saying yeah the FBI's got a rewrite policy they shouldn't be looking at a campaign that's terribly intrusive well yeah it's intrusive but they followed the rules there was not misconduct in opening and conducting the cases in fact in one instance I'm reading here it finds that the FBI actually went above and beyond existing policies so for example apparently somebody wore a wire Suncoast operating source wore a wire against somebody in this investigation an FBI policy says a field supervisor can approve that it on a squad level they went all the way to the assistant

being and I just you know I guess I'm old enough to remember the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails and I don't remember a single Republican ever going on the record and saying they didn't support the idea of investigating a person running for president so again it's it's it's certainly a legitimate debate to have as a country how do you investigate a campaign where there's suspicion of

certain times the standard is purposefully low with in other words the threshold the operations guidelines provides for two types of investigations preliminary and full a preliminary investigation may be open based upon quote any allegation or information end quote indicative a possible criminal activity or threats to the national security it's purposefully set low why is it purposefully set low because you can't investigate a case before you investigate a case you open the case I should better state it you can't know the results of an investigation before you open the investigation you set the threshold low you use all the lawful tools at your disposal and then you make a determination whether or not you can charge someone with a crime or you have some counterintelligence matter that

his words Nicole he says the elite doctor general's report now makes clear that the FBI launched an intrusive investigation of a u.s. presidential campaign on the thinnest of suspicions that in my view were insufficient to justify the steps taken that sentence alone shows you that the Attorney General is disagreeing with his Inspector General and the top line that we're all learning today which is that there was no evidence of political bias and opening this investigation and the only area where the collector General is questioning the mistakes that were made have to do with a FISA warrant that was not critical to the investigation in the first place so from the Attorney General coming in the first page of a report put out by his Justice Department says this the decision to open crossfire hurricane and for individual cases on current and former members of the Trump campaign George papadopolis Carter page Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn the early investigative steps taken and whether the openings and early steps complied with Department and FBI policies he finds no wrongdoing there I mean I guess what's so stunning is to stand in front of that building and read a statement from an attorney general refuting a document from his own Department what explains that Julia well you have to think about where the Attorney General stands now he has someone who just appointed John Durham the US attorney in Connecticut to do a criminal investigation into this very same matter Nicole so the Attorney General wants to look at what is being exposed today as something to justify that investigation and to try to you know kind of build a case for what he has said this is the same attorney in general who said that he believed there may have been spying on the Trump campaign that is not anywhere in this Inspector General report if I could I'd just like to read the next line of this too because he keeps making this case he says it is also clear that from its inception the investigation the evidence produced by the investigation was consistently exculpatory I think you could read at 430 pages of the Moller report to show that it was not all exculpatory evidence that there are a lot of very difficult legal decisions that were made along the way but this attorney general is making no lines blurred when it comes to how he views this inspector general report and how he viewed this entire investigation from the FBI through two molars conclusions help me understand this Frank the Attorney General disparages and does not believe in the robert muller investigation 23 months long guilty convictions guilty pleas by Mike Flynn by Paul Manafort by Roger stone the American attorney general does not believe his own departments Inspector General report I think if there's reason for concern today it's it's in sort of what is the evidence that he's looking at the facts well he's choosing to ignore the facts and what he's actually choosing to do is look at possible necessity of policy and procedure changes because I'm not in here to what I'm seeing here for example in the report is reference to the fact that wow the FBI actually doesn't have any written policy on investigating a president and his campaign so they went with the policy that they had and they complied with it they comported with existing policy so what I think you're going to hear is a steady drumbeat now is saying yeah the FBI's got a rewrite policy they shouldn't be looking at a campaign that's terribly intrusive well yeah it's intrusive but they followed the rules there was not misconduct in opening and conducting the cases in fact in one instance I'm reading here it finds that the FBI actually went above and beyond existing policies so for example apparently somebody wore a wire Suncoast operating source wore a wire against somebody in this investigation an FBI policy says a field supervisor can approve that it on a squad level they went all the way to the assistant director of counterintelligence to prove that wearing a wire so you're going to see evidence in here of extra rule-following but you're going to see the White House in the AG say I don't like the policy of this I don't like the smell of investigating a campaign and I'll ask him this would you have liked it if it was Obama being investigated or do you not like the policy because it's your guy being and I just you know I guess I'm old enough to remember the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails and I don't remember a single Republican ever going on the record and saying they didn't support the idea of investigating a person running for president so again it's it's it's certainly a legitimate debate to have as a country how do you investigate a campaign where there's suspicion of wrongdoing but it's just mind boggling that this is the second years long investigation into the president's campaign that bar doesn't believe well I understood Julia Ainsley just say that the

like the guidelines with which they complied did he complain about them when they were applied to the Hillary Clinton County I don't know him to have ever complained but this is a really important point let me just read from the report the FBI has something called a domestic investigations Operations guide that is one of the two main documents that tells the FBI what it can do and when it can do it they also have attorney general guidelines that have the same purpose using those two documents together the FBI is instructed on the propriety of investigating and opening investigations at certain times the standard is purposefully low with in other words the threshold the operations guidelines provides for two types of investigations preliminary and full a preliminary investigation may be open based upon quote any allegation or information end quote indicative a possible criminal activity or threats to the national security it's purposefully set low why is it purposefully set low because you can't investigate a case before you investigate a case you open the case I should better state it you can't know the results of an investigation before you open the investigation you set the threshold low you use all the lawful tools at your disposal and then you make a determination whether or not you can charge someone with a crime or you have some counterintelligence matter that you have to act upon it set low for a purpose the Attorney General apparently doesn't like that he has the authority to change it but you can't criticize the FBI for following its guidelines

necessity of policy and procedure changes because I'm not in here to what I'm seeing here for example in the report is reference to the fact that wow the FBI actually doesn't have any written policy on investigating a president and his campaign so they went with the policy that they had and they complied with it they comported with existing policy so what I think you're going to hear is a steady drumbeat now is saying yeah the FBI's got a rewrite policy they shouldn't be looking at a campaign that's terribly intrusive well yeah it's intrusive but they followed the rules there was not misconduct in opening and conducting the cases in fact in one instance I'm reading here it finds that the FBI actually went above and beyond existing policies so for example apparently somebody wore a wire Suncoast operating source wore a wire against somebody in this investigation an FBI policy says a field supervisor can approve that it on a squad level they went all the way to the assistant

being and I just you know I guess I'm old enough to remember the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails and I don't remember a single Republican ever going on the record and saying they didn't support the idea of investigating a person running for president so again it's it's it's certainly a legitimate debate to have as a country how do you investigate a campaign where there's suspicion of wrongdoing but it's just mind boggling that this is the second years long investigation into the president's campaign that bar doesn't believe well I understood Julia Ainsley just say that the Attorney General characterized the standard as insufficient in my view so to Frank's point it's not that they didn't comply with their guidelines it sounds more like the Attorney General just doesn't like the guidelines with which they complied did he complain about them when they were applied to the Hillary Clinton County I don't know him to have ever complained but this is a really important point let me just read from the report the FBI has something called a domestic investigations Operations guide that is one of the two main documents that tells the FBI what it can do and when it can do it they also have attorney general guidelines that have the same purpose using those two documents together the FBI is instructed on the propriety of investigating and opening investigations at certain times the standard is purposefully low with in other words the threshold the operations guidelines provides for two types of investigations preliminary and full a preliminary investigation may be open based upon quote any allegation or information end quote indicative a possible criminal activity or threats to the national security it's purposefully set low why is it purposefully set low because you can't investigate a case before you investigate a case you open the case I should better state it you can't know the results of an investigation before you open the investigation you set the threshold low you use all the lawful tools at your disposal and then you make a determination whether or not you can charge someone with a crime or you have some counterintelligence matter that you have to act upon it set low for a purpose the Attorney General apparently doesn't like that he has the authority to change it but you can't criticize the FBI for following its guidelines
