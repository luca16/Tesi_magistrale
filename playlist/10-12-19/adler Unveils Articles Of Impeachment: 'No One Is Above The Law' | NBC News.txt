 over the last several months the investigative committees of the house have been engaged in an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump's efforts to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 elections efforts that compromised our national security and threatened the integrity of our elections throughout this inquiry he has attempted to conceal the evidence from Congress and from the American people our president holds the ultimate public trust when he betrays that trust and puts himself before country he endangered the Constitution he endangered our democracy and he endangered our national security the framers of the Constitution prescribed a clear remedy for presidents who so violate their oath of office that is the power of impeachment today in service to our duty to the Constitution and to our country the House Committee on the judiciary is introducing two articles of impeachment charging the President of the United States Donald J Trump with committing high crimes and misdemeanors the first article is for abuse of power it is an impeachable offense for the president to exercise the powers of his public office to obtain an improper personal benefit while ignoring or in injuring the national interest that is exactly what President Trump did when he solicited and pressured Ukraine to interfere in our 2020 presidential election thus damaging our national security undermining the integrity of the next election and violating his oath to the American people these actions moreover are consistent with president Trump's previous invitations of foreign interference in our 2016 presidential election and when he was caught when the house investigated and opened an impeachment inquiry president Trump engaged in unprecedented categorical and indiscriminate defiance of the impeachment inquiry this gives rise to the second article of impeachment for obstruction of Congress here too we see a familiar pattern and president Trump's misconduct a president who declares himself above accountability above the American people and above Congress's power of impeachment which is meant to protect against threats to our democratic institutions is a president who sees himself as above the law we must be clear no one not even the president is above the law I want to recognize the great contributions of the investigative chairs particularly Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff Barton Affairs Chairman eliot engel Committee on Oversight and Reform former chairman the late Elijah Cummings and its new chairwoman carolyn Maloney Financial Services chairwoman Maxine Waters and Ways and Means chairman Richard Neal who helped lay the foundation for the articles we are introducing today I also want to thank my Judiciary Committee colleagues who are critical in our work to hold the president accountable and then the drafting of these articles later this week the Judiciary Committee will meet to consider these articles of impeachment and to make a recommendation to the full House of Representatives we do not take this action lightly but we have taken an oath to defend the Constitution and unlike President Trump we understand that our duty first and foremost is to protect the Constitution and to protect the interests of the American people that is why we must take this solemn step today elections are the cornerstone of democracy and are foundational to the rule of law but the integrity of our next election is at risk from a president who has already sought foreign interference in the 2016 and 2020 elections and who consistently puts himself above country that is why we must act now hey NBC News viewers thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down here and click on any of the videos over here to watch the latest interviews show highlights and digital exclusives thanks for watching
