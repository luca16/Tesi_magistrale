 now to our special report tonight with major implications for where impeachment is headed we begin with a fact of life for president under investigation via congressional or criminal investigation there's major pressure on their most trusted and senior aides to testify that puts the aides in a tough spot between their obligation to cooperate the obligation their boss and the legitimate limits on what they say President Clinton's advisors face that pressure during the Whitewater probe from his spokesman and confident George Stephanopoulos remember when he was doing politics to key counsel Bruce Lindsey to Sidney Blumenthal a loyal Clinton adviser who cooperated with the grand jury and testimony that later became public he famously told jurors that he asked President Clinton what have you done wrong and the president replied nothing and then after cooperating Blumenthal face the cameras dramatically on the courthouse steps and criticized Ken Starr for hauling him before a grand jury under those circumstances I never imagined that in America I would be hauled before a federal grand jury to answer questions if they think they have intimidated me they have failed now there are many example of aides walking this line throughout history and not just in the often sided impeach of examples of Clinton or Nixon president george w bush pasty-faced an investigation with some parallels to today's Ukraine scandal and that the president has major foreign policy powers but that's what makes their potential abuse so significant these could be matters of life and death Bush aides found themselves interrogated by the Muller of their era Patrick Fitzgerald about alleged abuse of powers those same foreign policy powers outing a CIA operative for allegedly political purposes think about that abusing national security powers for politics that's a crime and soon some of Bush's most trusted aides were under a microscope testifying like Karl Rove and Alberto Gonzales or indicted and convicted like Scooter Libby in a related come before this general Alberto Gonzalez told a congressional panel he made mistakes and insisted politics was not a factor in the firing of eight federal prosecutors that was the time when mr. Gonzalez was testifying to Congress about their investigation he ultimately was ousted over some of those issues now there were those battles then President Bush claiming executive privilege and trying to prevent Rowe and others from facing Congress why am I telling you all this right now well there is context for this pickle the Mick Mulvaney is in tonight right now as his team goes to court arguing about whether he can testify against Trump and there could be legitimate limits on testimony classified material privileges that do apply now on the list of current Trump aids Mulvaney is number one not only in the org chart but also in allegedly overseeing the Ukraine bribery plot including his famous televised confession did he also mentioned to me and past that the the the corruption related to the DNC server absolutely no question about that clearly you just described is a quid pro quo we do that all the time with foreign policy that's it and that's why we held up the money that's it so emphatic but that was not it as we reported in a breakdown on the beat of a knees press conference made him appear among the witnesses stating there was bribery there is only to move back as he tried to retract his own televised confession so Mulvaney has done a lot to make himself an even more sought-after witness and to impeach his own credibility so to speak whenever one thinks of Mulvaney and he does look a little guilty because he confessed and then took it back in fairness his situation does reflect attention to other aides of faced when pressed to testify and that's the context for one of the strangest turns an impeachment right now call it Mulvaney versus trump Mulvaney trying to join a lawsuit against his boss Trump well Danny's team is in court tonight with a move that makes fitting headlines for a year where it seems like everything has already happened but not this he is trying to join this lawsuit against Trump that basically asked the court to decide if Mulvaney should testify against his boss now that is unusual Mullaney could just fight this request outright arguing executive privilege or if he thinks the truth is good for him and Trump he could just go down and testify right he's already made this whole argument on live TV he could make it again to Congress or he could adjust it but instead he is now trying to join the lawsuit against Trump with an Austin Trump aide Charles Kupperman who was a former deputy to John Bolton and Bolton's key here cuz he has all kinds of bad things reportedly to say about the bribery plot he even reportedly said he wanted no part of a quote drug deal that Solomon and Mulvaney are cooking up so Mulvaney is trying to join forces with the person who accuses him of cooking up a drug deal John Bolton who is flabbergasted at the move the Washington Post reporting the whole thing highlights these internal divisions in Trump land the implication here is if Bolton's deputies making a genuine request for a judge to give the green light to talk while Mulvaney is jumping in to muddy the waters and maybe seize on the ruling if he gets supported for the Trump position opposing talking a strategy here is basically this wouldn't cost Mulvaney much if he gets a ruling forcing him to talk he could just go back to trying to defy these other requests like other Trump officials have that's the gamut but before we bring in our experts look at the substance here Bolton's deputy is making a serious argument that like other aides before him he's now caught between the competing demand of Trump in Congress and in a nod towards the significance of the Democrats impeachment probe bonds deputy says if he chooses wrong or if he clams up too fast he could inflict grave constitutional injury on the house impeachment probe and finally this brief cites some precedent that Trump and presumably mr. Bolton may be concerned about that Congress has more power to force testimony when probing quote misconduct by impeachable officials impeachable officials the president's the most important impeachable official there is so while these White House officials do follow a long line of aides who have wrestled with these dilemmas and some of them are real rarely do you ever see a chief of staff join a suit against his own boss the President or do what Mulvaney's doing right now this evening asking a court to tell him whether to reject his own presidents order or make common cause with other officials who've accused him of a bribery plot that may be impeachable let alone an official who reportedly accused him of cooking up a drug deal hey i'm ari melbourne from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our YouTube ch
