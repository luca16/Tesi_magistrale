    "DOCUMENT" : "joining me now is Pennsylvania Democratic congressman Madeline Dean which is a member of the House Judiciary Committee which ultimately may be called up on to draft articles of impeachment congressman thank you very much for joining us as as Jeff Bennett just laid out he said the first 45 minutes first hour of these public hearings Democrats believe that they're going to be able to lay it all out if that's the only hour the public watches are the Democrats basically saying that they're going to be able to convince the public in that first hour on Wednesday that the president committed an impeachable offense I don't think it's up to one hour and it's not up to just convincing the people by way of one witness but what we are going to see and what we've already seen through some of the release transcripts is career courageous legacy employees people who have worked in the State Department and other departments for our country coming forward and corroborating the same pattern of abuse by this administration they actually tried to extort the president of Ukraine saying that we will withhold aid basically they did withhold aid and asked that he makes sure he announces publicly investigations into a political foe it's not going to be about one hour it's going to be about getting the facts before the American public and these courageous people are coming forward to do that first they have done it through the investigations that are being done in private and now this week you will see in public whether it's mr. Taylor ambassador Jovanovic mr. Kent and others coming forward to tell the exact same pattern of extortion the attempt by this president to ask demand frankly a foreign country to interfere in our elections how sadly far we've come our Democrats prepared for Republicans to gum up the process we saw this a couple weeks ago when Laura Cooper whose testimony was just released today was supposed to testify Republicans storm the skiff and holds up that testimony for five hours we've gotten indications and reporting from Republicans that they plan on doing just that when these public hearings start on Wednesday try to slow up the process our Democrats prepared for it and what will they do Americans saw that as the shameful stunt that it was storming ask if that most of those members had the right and really responsibility to be in to be there to listen to testimony to ask questions and then flippantly order pizza I'll tell you what our caucus takes this very differently we take this seriously soberly sombrely as Nancy Pelosi says we take it prayerfully we are on a journey for this country that is so serious and so grave that I hope our Republican counterparts on my committee and these other Committees of jurisdiction take it for that somber moment that it is it's impossible to believe that stunts are the way to go forward on an impeachment inquiry when the corruption and the wrongdoing of this administration has been corroborated by so many let me so I call upon the Republicans to make sure that they take it with the same seriousness and talk about the facts not nonsense well let's talk about the facts and the public's reaction to the facts how much do you need the public to get on the side of impeachment before voting on impeachment our articles of impeachment contingent upon poll numbers that show the American public is behind impeaching the president does it need to be doesn't need to be overwhelming I don't I don't watch the polls but I do believe that this is a case that we have to put before the American people and make sure that they understand and believe the evidence believe the evidence of wrongdoing believe the evidence of a president on a phone call with Ukraine asking this president who is under foreign intervention five years of invasion by our foe and their foe Russia to make sure that he comes forward with investigations of the Biden's a political opponent before he will get the much-needed aid he asked for he asked literally for military aid talked about javelins and the need for it and the president said I will need a favor from you though the American people have a right to hear the evidence to know the evidence yes and and we need to put that before them before we come forward with articles of impeachment or the vote let me ask you this I asked about poll numbers because right now it looks like if there is an impeachment vote it's going to be down party lines no Republicans have shown support for the impeachment inquiry and it's I think a high high bar for a Republican to decide to vote to impeach the president as of now so if the polling comes out that shows the public is overwhelmingly behind the Democrats on this my assessment of the situation shows that that's the only way that Republicans might get on board if it looks like they're their seats are in peril in some way if their constituents want them to vote to impeach so do you need to see those numbers to get the Republicans on board and if not if not are you comfortable having this be a party line vote oh dear what you described is awfully seriously grave I hope that is not the way this is considered by anybody democrat or republican our founders put in the the the ability to impeach a sitting president only for the most serious of violations of his oath of office so I hope that the Republicans take their oath of office as seriously I get when you say you get that and I'm not trying to be disrespectful but I do think we need to look at the landscape as it stands right now and what the Republicans have said and are willing to do to defend the president so it seems like it is a very high bar for them and my question is are you comfortable making this a party line vote because that what that is what it where it looks at it like it is heading I will not leap to that conclusion because we have not completed the investigation we have not completed putting the information before the American public I hope this does not come down to a party line vote I hope it comes down to the right vote a vote based on the evidence and upholding my oath of office to the Constitution and the president's oath of office to the Constitution I pray it does not come down to so cynical a party line vote and I've never been one to say that no Republican will ever vote for impeachment we're not there yet let's get the evidence out before the American people in a public way there are very good people on both sides of the aisle who have the ability to analyze the evidence I hope without consideration for the next primary I hear what you're saying but so many Republicans have said they refused to read the transcripts look at Lindsey Graham is one of

Republicans storm the skiff and holds up that testimony for five hours we've gotten indications and reporting from Republicans that they plan on doing just that when these public hearings start on Wednesday try to slow up the process our Democrats prepared for it and what will they do Americans saw that as the shameful stunt that it was storming ask if that most of those members had the right and really responsibility to be in to be there to listen to testimony to ask questions and then flippantly order pizza I'll tell you what our caucus takes this very differently we take this seriously soberly sombrely as Nancy Pelosi says we take it prayerfully we are on a journey for this country that is so serious and so grave that I hope our Republican counterparts on my committee and these other Committees of jurisdiction take it for that somber moment that it is it's impossible to believe that stunts are the way to go forward on an impeachment inquiry when the corruption and the wrongdoing of this administration has been corroborated by so many let me so I call upon the Republicans to make sure that they take it with the same seriousness and talk about the facts not nonsense well let's talk about the facts and the public's reaction to the facts how much do you need the public to get on the side of impeachment before voting on impeachment our articles of impeachment contingent upon poll numbers that show the American public is behind impeaching the president does it need to be doesn't need to be overwhelming I don't I don't watch the polls but I do believe that this is a case that we have to put before the American people and make sure that they understand and believe the evidence believe the evidence of wrongdoing believe the evidence of a president on a phone call with Ukraine asking this president who is under foreign intervention five years of invasion by our foe and their foe Russia to make sure that he comes forward with investigations of the Biden's a political opponent before he will get the much-needed aid he asked for he asked literally for military aid talked about javelins and the need for it and the president said I will need a favor from you though the American people have a right to hear the evidence to know the evidence yes and and we need to put that before them before we come forward with articles of impeachment or the vote let me ask you this I asked about poll numbers because right now it looks like if there is an impeachment vote it's going to be down party lines no Republicans have shown support for the impeachment inquiry and it's I think a high high bar for a Republican to decide to vote to impeach the president as of now so if the polling comes out that shows the public is overwhelmingly behind the Democrats on this my assessment of the situation shows that that's the only way that Republicans might get on board if it looks like they're their seats are in peril in some way if their constituents want them to vote to impeach so do you need to see those numbers to get the Republicans on board and if not if not are you comfortable having this be a party line vote oh dear what you described is awfully seriously grave I hope that is not the way this is considered by anybody democrat or republican our founders put in the the the ability to impeach a sitting president only for the most serious of violations of his oath of office so I hope that the Republicans take their oath of office as seriously I get when you say you get that and I'm not trying to be disrespectful but I do think we need to look at the landscape as it stands right now and what the Republicans have said and are willing to do to defend the president so it seems like it is a very high bar for them and my question is are you comfortable making this a party line vote because that what that is what it where it looks at it like it is heading I will not leap to that conclusion because we have not completed the investigation we have not completed putting the information before the American public I hope this does not come down to a party line vote I hope it comes down to the right vote a vote based on the evidence and upholding my oath of office to the Constitution and the president's oath of office to the Constitution I pray it does not come down to so cynical a party line vote and I've never been one to say that no Republican will ever vote for impeachment we're not there yet let's get the evidence out before the American people in a public way there are very good people on both sides of the aisle who have the ability to analyze the evidence I hope without consideration for the next primary I hear what you're saying but so many Republicans have said they refused to read the transcripts

contingent upon poll numbers that show the American public is behind impeaching the president does it need to be doesn't need to be overwhelming I don't I don't watch the polls but I do believe that this is a case that we have to put before the American people and make sure that they understand and believe the evidence believe the evidence of wrongdoing believe the evidence of a president on a phone call with Ukraine asking this president who is under foreign intervention five years of invasion by our foe and their foe Russia to make sure that he comes forward with investigations of the Biden's a political opponent before he will get the much-needed aid he asked for he asked literally for military aid talked about javelins and the need for it and the president said I will need a favor from you though the American people have a right to hear the evidence to know the evidence yes and and we need to put that before them before we come forward with articles of impeachment or the vote let me ask you this I asked about poll numbers because right now it looks like if there is an impeachment vote it's going to be down party lines no Republicans have shown support for the impeachment inquiry and it's I think a high high bar for a Republican to decide to vote to impeach the president as of now so if the polling comes out that shows the public is overwhelmingly behind the Democrats on this my assessment of the situation shows that that's the only way that Republicans might get on board if it looks like they're their seats are in peril in some way if their constituents want them to vote to impeach so do you need to see those numbers to get the Republicans on board and if not if not are you comfortable having this be a party line vote oh dear what you described is awfully seriously grave I hope that is not the way this is considered by anybody democrat or republican our founders put in the the the ability to impeach a sitting president only for the most serious of violations of his oath of office so I hope that the Republicans take their oath of office as seriously I get when you say you get that and I'm not trying to be disrespectful but I do think we need to look at the landscape as it stands right now and what the Republicans have said and are willing to do to defend the president so it seems like it is a very high bar for them and my question is are you comfortable making this a party line vote because that what that is what it where it looks at it like it is heading I will not leap to that conclusion because we have not completed the investigation we have not completed putting the information before the American public I hope this does not come down to a party line vote I hope it comes down to the right vote a vote based on the evidence and upholding my oath of office to the Constitution and the president's oath of office to the Constitution I pray it does not come down to so cynical a party line vote and I've never been one to say that no Republican will ever vote for impeachment we're not there yet let's get the evidence out before the American people in a public way there are very good people on both sides of the aisle who have the ability to analyze the evidence I hope without consideration for the next primary I hear what you're saying but so many Republicans have said they refused to read the transcripts

soberly sombrely as Nancy Pelosi says we take it prayerfully we are on a journey for this country that is so serious and so grave that I hope our Republican counterparts on my committee and these other Committees of jurisdiction take it for that somber moment that it is it's impossible to believe that stunts are the way to go forward on an impeachment inquiry when the corruption and the wrongdoing of this administration has been corroborated by so many let me so I call upon the Republicans to make sure that they take it with the same seriousness and talk about the facts not nonsense well let's talk about the facts and the public's reaction to the facts how much do you need the public to get on the side of impeachment before voting on impeachment our articles of impeachment contingent upon poll numbers that show the American public is behind impeaching the president does it need to be doesn't need to be overwhelming I don't I don't watch the polls but I do believe that this is a case that we have to put before the American people and make sure that they understand and believe the evidence believe the evidence of wrongdoing believe the evidence of a president on a phone call with Ukraine asking this president who is under foreign intervention five years of invasion by our foe and their foe Russia to make sure that he comes forward with investigations of the Biden's a political opponent before he will get the much-needed aid he asked for he asked literally for military aid talked about javelins and the need for it and the president said I will need a favor from you though the American people have a right to hear the evidence to know the evidence yes and and we need to put that before them before we come forward with articles of impeachment or the vote let me ask you this I asked about poll numbers because right now it looks like if there is an impeachment vote it's going to be down party lines no Republicans have shown support for the impeachment inquiry and it's I think a high high bar for a Republican to decide to vote to impeach the president as of now so if the polling comes out that shows the public is overwhelmingly behind the Democrats on this my assessment of the situation shows that that's the only way that Republicans might get on board if it looks like they're their seats are in peril in some way if their constituents want them to vote to impeach so do you need to see those numbers to get the Republicans on board and if not if not are you comfortable having this be a party line vote oh dear what you described is awfully seriously grave I hope that is not the way this is considered by anybody democrat or republican our founders put in the the the ability to impeach a sitting president only for the most serious of violations of his oath of office so I hope that the Republicans take their oath of office as seriously I get when you say you get that and I'm not trying to be disrespectful but I do think we need to look at the landscape as it stands right now and what the Republicans have said and are willing to do to defend the president so it seems like it is a very high bar for them and my question is are you comfortable making this a party line vote because that what that is what it where it looks at it like it is heading I will not leap to that conclusion because we have not completed the investigation we have not completed putting the information before the American public I hope this does not come down to a party line vote I hope it comes down to the right vote a vote based on the evidence and upholding my oath of office to the Constitution and the president's oath of office to the Constitution I pray it does not come down to so cynical a party line vote and I've never been one to say that no Republican will ever vote for impeachment we're not there yet let's get the evidence out before the American people in a public way there are very good people on both sides of the aisle who have the ability to analyze the evidence I hope without consideration for the next primary I hear what you're saying but so many Republicans have said they refused to read the transcripts

            "BASE" : "Kent and others coming forward to tell the exact same pattern of extortion the attempt by this president to ask demand frankly a foreign country to interfere in our elections how sadly far we've come our Democrats prepared for Republicans to gum up the process we saw this a couple weeks ago when Laura Cooper whose testimony was just released today was supposed to testify Republicans storm the skiff and holds up that testimony for five hours we've gotten indications and reporting from Republicans that they plan on doing just that when these public hearings start on Wednesday try to slow up the process our Democrats prepared for it and what will they do Americans saw that as the shameful stunt that it was storming ask if that most of those members had the right and really responsibility to be in to be there to listen to testimony to ask questions and then flippantly order pizza I'll tell you what our caucus takes this very differently we take this seriously soberly sombrely as Nancy Pelosi says we take it prayerfully we are on a journey for this country that is so serious and so grave that I hope our Republican counterparts on my committee and these other Committees of jurisdiction take it for that somber moment that it is it's impossible to believe that stunts are the way to go forward on an impeachment inquiry when the corruption and the wrongdoing of this administration has been corroborated by so many let me so I call upon the Republicans to make sure that they take it with the same seriousness and talk about the facts not nonsense well let's talk about the facts and the public's reaction to the facts how much do you need the public to get on the side of impeachment before voting on impeachment our articles of impeachment contingent upon poll numbers that show the American public is behind impeaching the president does it need to be doesn't need to be overwhelming I don't I don't watch the polls but I do believe that this is a case that we have to put before the American people and make sure that they understand and believe the evidence believe the evidence of wrongdoing believe the evidence of a president on a phone call with Ukraine asking this president who is under foreign intervention five years of invasion by our foe and their foe Russia to make sure that he comes forward with investigations of the Biden's a political opponent before he will get the much-needed aid he asked for he asked literally for military aid talked about javelins and the need for it and the president said I will need a favor from you though the American people have a right to hear the evidence to know the evidence yes and and we need to put that before them before we come forward with articles of impeachment or the vote let me ask you this I asked about poll numbers because right now it looks like if there is an impeachment vote it's going to be down party lines no Republicans have shown support for the impeachment inquiry and it's I think a high high bar for a Republican to decide to vote to impeach the president as of now so if the polling comes out that shows the public is overwhelmingly behind the Democrats on this my assessment of the situation shows that that's the only way that Republicans might get on board if it looks like they're their seats are in peril in some way if their constituents want them to vote to impeach so do you need to see those numbers to get the Republicans on board and if not if not are you comfortable having this be a party line vote oh dear what you described is awfully seriously grave I hope that is not the way this is considered by anybody democrat or republican our founders put in the the the ability to impeach a sitting president only for the most serious of violations of his oath of office so I hope that the Republicans take their oath of office as seriously I get when you say you get that and I'm not trying to be disrespectful but I do think we need to look at the landscape as it stands right now and what the Republicans have said and are willing to do to defend the president so it seems like it is a very high bar for them and my question is are you comfortable making this a party line vote because that what that is what it where it looks at it like it is heading I will not leap to that conclusion because we have not completed the investigation we have not completed putting the information before the American public I hope this does not come down to a party line vote I hope it comes down to the right vote a vote based on the evidence and upholding my oath of office to the Constitution and the president's oath of office to the Constitution I pray it does not come down to so cynical a party line vote and I've never been one to say that no Republican will ever vote for impeachment we're not there yet let's get the evidence out before the American people in a public way there are very good people on both sides of the aisle who have the ability to analyze the evidence I hope without consideration for the next primary I hear what you're saying but so many Republicans have said they refused to read the transcripts

Republicans storm the skiff and holds up that testimony for five hours we've gotten indications and reporting from Republicans that they plan on doing just that when these public hearings start on Wednesday try to slow up the process our Democrats prepared for it and what will they do Americans saw that as the shameful stunt that it was storming ask if that most of those members had the right

soberly sombrely as Nancy Pelosi says we take it prayerfully we are on a journey for this country that is so serious and so grave that I hope our Republican counterparts on my committee and these other Committees of jurisdiction take it for that somber moment that it is it's impossible to believe that stunts are the way to go forward on an impeachment inquiry when the corruption and the wrongdoing of this administration has been corroborated by so many let me so I call upon the Republicans to make sure that they take it with the same seriousness and talk about the facts not nonsense well let's talk about the facts and the public's reaction to the facts how much do you need the public to get on the side of impeachment before voting on impeachment our articles of impeachment contingent upon poll numbers that show the American public is behind impeaching the president does it need to be doesn't need to be overwhelming I don't I don't watch the polls but I do believe that this is a case that we have to put before the American people and make sure that they understand and believe the evidence believe the evidence of wrongdoing believe the evidence of a president on a phone call with Ukraine asking this president who is under foreign intervention five years of invasion by our foe and their foe Russia to make sure that he comes forward with investigations of the Biden's a political opponent before he will get the much-needed aid he asked for he asked literally for military aid talked about javelins and the need for it and the president said I will need a favor from you though the American people have a right to hear the evidence to know the evidence yes and and we need to put that before them before we come forward with articles of impeachment or the vote let me ask you this I asked about poll numbers because right now it looks like if there is an impeachment vote it's going to be down party lines no Republicans have shown support for the impeachment inquiry and it's I think a high high bar for a Republican to decide to vote to impeach the president as of now so if the polling comes out that shows the public is overwhelmingly behind the Democrats on this my assessment of the situation shows that that's the only way that Republicans might get on board if it looks like they're their seats are in peril in some way if their constituents want them to vote to impeach so do you need to see those numbers to get the Republicans on board and if not if not are you comfortable having this be a party line vote oh dear what you described is awfully seriously grave I hope that is not the way this is considered by anybody democrat or republican our founders put in the the the ability to impeach a sitting president only for the most serious of violations of his oath of office so I hope that the Republicans take their oath of office as seriously I get when you say you get that and I'm not trying to be disrespectful but I do think we need to look at the landscape as it stands right now and what the Republicans have said and are willing to do to defend the president so it seems like it is a very high bar for them and my question is are you comfortable making this a party line vote because that what that is what it where it looks at it like it is heading I will not leap to that conclusion because we have not completed the investigation we have not completed putting the information before the American public I hope this does not come down to a party line vote I hope it comes down to the right vote a vote based on the evidence and upholding my oath of office to the Constitution and the president's oath of office to the Constitution I pray it does not come down to so cynical a party line vote and I've never been one to say that no Republican will ever vote for impeachment we're not there yet let's get the evidence out before the American people in a public way there are very good people on both sides of the aisle who have the ability to analyze the evidence I hope without consideration for the next primary I hear what you're saying but so many Republicans have said they refused to read the transcripts

sadly far we've come our Democrats prepared for Republicans to gum up the process we saw this a couple weeks ago when Laura Cooper whose testimony was just released today was supposed to testify Republicans storm the skiff and holds up that testimony for five hours we've gotten indications and reporting from Republicans that they plan on doing just that when these public hearings start on Wednesday try to slow up the process our Democrats prepared for it and what will they do Americans saw that as the shameful stunt that it was storming ask if that most of those members had the right and really responsibility to be in to be there to listen to testimony to ask questions and then flippantly order pizza I'll tell you what our caucus takes this very differently we take this seriously soberly sombrely as Nancy Pelosi says we take it prayerfully we are on a journey for this country that is so serious and so grave that I hope our Republican counterparts on my committee and these other Committees of jurisdiction take it for that somber moment that it is it's impossible to believe that stunts are the way to go forward on an impeachment inquiry when the corruption and the wrongdoing of this administration has been corroborated by so many let me so I call upon the Republicans to make sure that they take it with the same seriousness and talk about the facts not nonsense well let's talk about the facts and the public's reaction to the facts how much do you need the public to get on the side of impeachment before voting on impeachment our articles of impeachment contingent upon poll numbers that show the American public is behind impeaching the president does it need to be doesn't need to be overwhelming I don't I don't watch the polls but I do believe that this is a case that we have to put before the American people and make sure that they understand and believe the evidence believe the evidence of wrongdoing believe the evidence of a president on a phone call with Ukraine asking this president who is under foreign intervention five years of invasion by our foe and their foe Russia to make sure that he comes forward with investigations of the Biden's a political opponent before he will get the much-needed aid he asked for he asked literally for military aid talked about javelins and the need for it and the president said I will need a favor from you though the American people have a right to hear the evidence to know the evidence yes and and we need to put that before them before we come forward with articles of impeachment or the vote let me ask you this I asked about poll numbers because right now it looks like if there is an impeachment vote it's going to be down party lines no Republicans have shown support for the impeachment inquiry and it's I think a high high bar for a Republican to decide to vote to impeach the president as of now so if the polling comes out that shows the public is overwhelmingly behind the Democrats on this my assessment of the situation shows that that's the only way that Republicans might get on board if it looks like they're their seats are in peril in some way if their constituents want them to vote to impeach so do you need to see those numbers to get the Republicans on board and if not if not are you comfortable having this be a party line vote oh dear what you described is awfully seriously grave I hope that is not the way this is considered by anybody democrat or republican our founders put in the the the ability to impeach a sitting president only for the most serious of violations of his oath of office so I hope that the Republicans take their oath of office as seriously I get when you say you get that and I'm not trying to be disrespectful but I do think we need to look at the landscape as it stands right now and what the Republicans have said and are willing to do to defend the president so it seems like it is a very high bar for them and my question is are you comfortable making this a party line vote because that what that is what it where it looks at it like it is heading I will not leap to that conclusion because we have not completed the investigation we have not completed putting the information before the American public I hope this does not come down to a party line vote I hope it comes down to the right vote a vote based on the evidence and upholding my oath of office to the Constitution and the president's oath of office to the Constitution I pray it does not come down to so cynical a party line vote and I've never been one to say that no Republican will ever vote for impeachment we're not there yet let's get the evidence out before the American people in a public way there are very good people on both sides of the aisle who have the ability to analyze the evidence I hope without consideration for the next primary I hear what you're saying but so many Republicans have said they refused to read the transcripts

the investigation we have not completed putting the information before the American public I hope this does not come down to a party line vote I hope it comes down to the right vote a vote based on the evidence and upholding my oath of office to the Constitution and the president's oath of office to the Constitution I pray it does not come down to so cynical a party line vote and I've never been one to say that no Republican will ever vote for impeachment we're not there yet let's get the evidence out before the American people in a public way there are very good people on both sides of the

wrongdoing of this administration has been corroborated by so many let me so I call upon the Republicans to make sure that they take it with the same seriousness and talk about the facts not nonsense well let's talk about the facts and the public's reaction to the facts how much do you need the public to get on the side of impeachment before voting on impeachment our articles of impeachment contingent upon poll numbers that show the American public is behind impeaching the president does it need to be doesn't need to be overwhelming I don't I don't watch the polls but I do believe that this is a case that we have to put before the American people and make sure that they understand and believe the evidence believe the evidence of wrongdoing believe the evidence of a president on a phone call with Ukraine asking this president who is under foreign intervention five years of invasion by our foe and their foe Russia to make sure that he comes forward with investigations of the Biden's a political opponent before he will get the much-needed aid he asked for he asked literally for military aid talked about javelins and the need for it and the president said I will need a favor from you though the American people have a right to hear the evidence to know the evidence yes and and we need to put that before them before we come forward with articles of impeachment or the vote let me ask you this I asked about poll numbers because right now it looks like if there is an impeachment vote it's going to be down party lines no Republicans have shown support for the impeachment inquiry and it's I think a high high bar for a Republican to decide to vote to impeach the president as of now so if the polling comes out that shows the public is overwhelmingly behind the Democrats on this my assessment of the situation shows that that's the only way that Republicans might get on board if it looks like they're their seats are in peril in some way if their constituents want them to vote to impeach so do you need to see those numbers to get the Republicans on board and if not if not are you comfortable having this be a party line vote oh dear what you described is awfully seriously grave I hope that is not the way this is considered by anybody democrat or republican our founders put in the the the ability to impeach a sitting president only for the most serious of violations of his oath of office so I hope that the Republicans take their oath of office as seriously I get when you say you get that and I'm not trying to be disrespectful but I do think we need to look at the landscape as it stands right now and what the Republicans have said and are willing to do to defend the president so it seems like it is a very high bar for them and my

described is awfully seriously grave I hope that is not the way this is considered by anybody democrat or republican our founders put in the the the ability to impeach a sitting president only for the most serious of violations of his oath of office so I hope that the Republicans take their oath of office as seriously I get when you say you get that and I'm not trying to be disrespectful but I do think we need to look at the landscape as it stands right now and what the Republicans have said and are willing to do to defend the president so it seems like it is a very high bar for them and my question is are you comfortable making this a party line vote because that what that is what it where it looks at it like it is heading I will not leap to that conclusion because we have not completed the investigation we have not completed putting the information before the American public I hope this does not come down to a party line vote I hope it comes down to the right vote a vote based on the evidence and upholding my oath of office to the Constitution and the president's oath of office to the Constitution I pray it does not come down to so cynical a party line vote and I've never been one to say that no Republican will ever vote for impeachment we're not there yet let's get the evidence out before the American people in a public way there are very good people on both sides of the aisle who have the ability to analyze the evidence I hope without consideration for the next primary I hear what you're saying but so many Republicans have said they refused to read the transcripts
