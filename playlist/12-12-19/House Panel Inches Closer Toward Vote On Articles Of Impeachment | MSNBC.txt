Jeff let's talk about how far we have gone because they have not yet had a roll call on this second profit amendment from Matt Gaetz which was introduced with a lot of controversy because he was repeating all kinds of untested allegations against hunter Biden trying to substitute hunter Biden for the Joe Biden aspect of article 1 in the abuse of power lines you're right about that Andrea a decided lack of self awareness on the part of congressman Matt Gaetz and as you mentioned he was checked by congressman Hank Johnson given that Gates has a record of a DUI arrest but for the most part setting aside those few glaring exceptions the proceeding that we have seen today has been mostly subdued and orderly given the way that things can typically go in this ultra partisan committee so yes you heard from Democrats a recitation of the facts in evidence Democrats trying to make the argument that the impeachment case that they are bringing is ironclad and thorough you heard from Republicans re-litigation of the entire process that has got us to this point Republicans making making the argument that the Democrats the evidence that the Democrats have offered is thin so we've been through what two amendments there are certainly several more to go one expects but this panel is inching slowly toward this vote on these two articles of impeachment we do accept we do expect a 23 to 17 party line vote it would normally be 24 to 20 to 17 but congressman Ted blue is at home recovering from a medical procedure meanwhile as this was happening you have Steve Scalise the Minority Whip he sent an email to the Republican offices telling them to vote no on those articles of impeachment House Speaker Nancy Pelosi held her usual Thursday press conference where she talked to us reporters I asked her a question about whether or not she was expecting to or preparing for more than two Democratic defections to Democratic no votes when this impeachment vote hits the floor next week so there are those two members who voted against the impeachment rules package some months ago you have Jeff Andrew from New Jersey and Colin Peterson from Minnesota both represent states that President Trump won in 2016 but the speaker said what she said before that she is not whipping the spoke meaning she is not pressing members and then checking in with them and trying to make them vote one way or the other in this case it would be yes vote she says that Democrats have to vote their their conscience on this the truth of it is she can afford to lose 17 Democrats and still have the numbers that she needs to get these impeachment articles moved off the floor which would tee up a Senate trial early next year Andrea and we have some some of that briefing that Nancy Pelosi gave today let's play that now we had put forth our articles of impeachment I'm very proud of all the committee six committees had been working on this for very long time this is nothing Swift about it but it is urgent and so we will be bringing the articles the committee will work on it today as you know this I don't know if it's this morning or this afternoon that depends on the pace in the committee and then next week we'll take up something Jeff I want to bring in Susan as well who was there for that briefing but let me ask you first how many more amendments we still have to see the vote on the Matt Gaetz amendment when they come back from the other business that they're doing on the House floor and then how many more do you expect from the Republican side I would say anywhere between five to seven the specific number is unclear but yes Republicans want to get on the record with all of the changes they want to make Democrats as we've seen unfold today we were told going into this hearing that they weren't going to make any changes they're not going to offer any amendments because the House speaker and House leadership have already blessed these articles of impeachment as they're written there was one change the Chairman's Nadler made this morning and that was to change Donald J Trump - Donald John Trump to include the president's full name in the articles as they're currently written and read and that change was a procedural one which would give him as having a proposed an amendment the right to take certain steps as the chair that's right you're right about that hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or over on this list to see lots of other great videos
