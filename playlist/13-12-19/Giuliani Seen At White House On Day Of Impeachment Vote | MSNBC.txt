 as of earlier this morning the president wasn't watching the proceedings live on television we do know that Rudy Giuliani is at the White House we saw him and since you know the ground so well this will make some sense to you but he's walking from the old executive office building Eisenhower office building into the West Wing accompanied by his son who also works here we don't know and I stress no one will tell us here whether or not Rudy has a meeting on the schedule with the President of the United States we do know that President Donald Trump is meeting his Paraguayan counterpart they're likely to talk and meet the cameras at about 11:10 and it's at that point that we'll get some sort of sense of where the president is on this next phase and I think crucially we should be able to tell whether or not he spoke with Rudy Giuliani to what extent the president reads out this idea of whatever Rudy came up with in Ukraine coming back with remember the president said he's that Rudy was eager to share his findings we may see whether or not Rudy Giuliani got to the president and if he is still the president's personal attorney call so many echoes of fascinating history we talk about two generations of Giuliani's walking from the oeob to the building that houses the West Wing and the residents what's amazing to me Hans this is also a story no matter what you think of Donald J Trump of his brazenness the day after Robert s multiplied before Congress about Russian a Russian attack really on the 2016 election and Donald Trump reached out to another foreign government to seek their involvement their engagement in the 2020 election any sense that anyone there thinks that the president has taken anything from getting caught red-handed or is it all a story again and always about brazenness it seems it's business as usual here and there's a certain bunker mentality but that's been the mentality for if not the last six months the last three years you know there's a lot of discussion around who's actually going to represent the president when this trial goes to the Senate Pam Bondi was just on Fox News pouring cold water on the idea that Pat's if Leone is going to be the main attorney that we representing the president down there she had kind things to say about Pat Cipriani but on all this Nicole I just go back to what the president said about six weeks ago and he said the team is me and regardless we've actually there in the Senate and the well the Senate represented the president the president's still going to be his own attorney his own Dan defender and he'll do it whether it's on Twitter or without he's standing next to a foreign leader we are going to see what the president's latest reaction is here and just a little bit and I just stressed to listen carefully to see whether or not we think he's spoken to Rudy Giuliani beforehand where he goes after and whether or not he tries to tout this what looks to be at least from a Chinese side a completed trade deal because when you talk to the president's advisors on what really matters for his re-election they're actually not that focused on impeachment they'll mention it there's you get different views on it they're very focused on the state of the economy and the extent to which the US MCA the trade deal with Canada and Mexico as well as the China trade deal goose's the economy there's a broad recognition here that that is of crucial importance Nicole if only they could get their boss to focus on the same thing saans nichols at the White House for us thank you so much hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
