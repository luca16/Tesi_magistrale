 gonna get two more on this in just a moment but let's show you the latest polling that shows a majority of Americans support the impeachment inquiry into President Trump the latest CBS news YouGov poll has that approval at 53 percent 63 percent said that the Trump administration should cooperate with House Democrats the impeachment inquiry and 61 percent said the president should not ask foreign governments for help with election campaigns and I think you know it's important to highlight this because again the White House really wants to believe that people don't understand the the equation here they do and it's very clear just anecdotally you talk to people about it and they just don't like it it rubs them the wrong way they may not know about the legalities or illegalities of it which exist but in in just simple terms people are like no you don't do that that's not right yeah David Ignatius the only 12% almost one in 10 Americans are saying that it's okay for foreign countries to interfere with our elections and it's okay for Donald Trump Judy's doing but the number in this poll that is so fascinating to me and also puts pressure on the White House unless they just want to see their numbers just continue to collapse is where almost two-thirds of Americans are saying the White House needs to investigate are the White House needs to cooperate with this investigation with this impeachment inquiry 63 percent of Americans say the Trump administration Wow should cooperate with Nancy Pelosi should cooperate with Congress should cooperate with this impeachment query so as they Stonewall and look even more Nick Sounion by the day I suspect that 63% number just goes higher and Donald Trump only hurts himself politically even more so the strategy of the Trump administration since the beginning of these investigations has been just to try to defraud them to make people think it's all just this Washington a circus of the endless investigations back and forth and these poll numbers suggests that people aren't buying it that they that they do want to get to the bottom that they don't see the Ukraine investigation simply as an add-on to the Moller investigation there's a phrase I remember from the Watergate days I believe it was something that when a Bob Woodward sources said to him it was every tree in the forest will fall and I have a feeling that process is what we're beginning to see as people realize they face legal jeopardy as people like Gordon Sunland Fiona Hill realize they have to testify truthfully because these investigations aren't going to stop because they see those fall numbers too so I think as Jonathan and and and others have said that we're entering a different phase here there is a tipping point in this investigation I think this week we may go over that you know Jeff Mason autocrats tyrants people that are running that what some label ill liberal democracies across the world always attack the news always blame the news it's their way of escaping any responsibility for their evil deeds well in Donald Trump's case he's always blamed the news or he's blamed the news for reporting on Muller here this is a story that he's already admitted to in front of a bank of cameras that yes he's trying to get China he's trying to get Ukraine he's trying to get foreign countries do it more and to do it more they try and get in the metal and metal with American elections and I you see these numbers skyrocketing this is something that you may desperately try to blame the press or blame Democrats but it looks like Americans are on to him and as David Ignatius just said as this continues it looks like every tree may fall because people don't want to end up in jail they've seen the history of Watergate they don't want to be a part of it this time yeah absolutely and I think it's it's interesting how what what sort of ramifications that has for the White House strategy in dealing with all of this they're seeing this polling you're certainly right to say the president criticizes the media and lashes out at the media when he feels under pressure and that is usually a big part of his strategy and we've seen that in the last couple days last couple weeks but what we also saw last week was a letter from the White House to Nancy Pelosi saying essentially and crystallizing their strategy of we're not going to cooperate and yet the fact that these people are testifying this week the fact that the former ambassador to Ukraine testified on Friday sort of shows that that strategy is already crumbling I was talking to a White House official last week who said this makes it looks like this makes it looks like we're caving so the White House strategy seems to be coming sort of down just as the pressure on the president is going up thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of
