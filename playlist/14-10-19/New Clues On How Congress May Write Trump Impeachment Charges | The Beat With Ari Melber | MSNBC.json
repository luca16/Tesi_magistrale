    "DOCUMENT" : "welcome back I'm re Melbourne now in our special we turn to one of the most significant questions facing this Congress how is the house decide on impeachment charges and how if you launched this Pro Speaker Pelosi says you jump right in I'm announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry I'm directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella of impeachment inquiry the president must be held accountable no one is above the law Trump and his allies have been arguing for something different they say there should be an official Full House floor vote to trigger the formal impeachment probe now that is what the house did to begin the Nixon and Clinton impeachment so it has happened before but that doesn't mean it has to happen indeed the Constitution does not require anything like that now the House Intelligence Committee is leading the probe into whistleblower accusations against Donald Trump Pelosi has said the Judiciary Committee would ultimately be responsible for writing any actual articles of impeachment that's what happened in 1974 the program normally seen at this time will not be shown so that we may bring you the following NBC News special report impeachment the committee votes last night the House Judiciary Committee approved an article of impeachment against the President of the United States the charge was obstruction of justice Judiciary Committee there had two months of impeachment hearings on Richard Nixon you hear that discussion about the grave charge of obstruction of justice now when they voted it was two months later and every Democrat and six Republicans on the committee voted yes if we are to be faithful to our old to support the Constitution we must find him faithless in his and I cannot in good conscience turn away from the evidence of evil it is to me so clear and compelling he repeatedly and knowingly deceived the American people who trusted him and wanted to trust him my faith in the Constitution is whole it is completed is total and I am NOT going to sit here and be an idle spectator to the diminution the subversion the destruction of the Constitution as the saying goes this is what democracy looks like and Judiciary Committee ultimately passed three articles of impeachment against Nixon one on obstruction one on a broader abuse of power and the third interestingly when you think about today on defiance of congressional subpoenas and here's something else to make contrast with today that President Richard Nixon resigned just about a week later avoiding what looked like almost certain impeachment twenty four years later now as another Judiciary Committee considers impeaching a president well no surprise Nixon on their minds the day Richard Nixon failed answer that subpoena is the day that he was subject to impeachment because he took the power from Congress that's Republican Lindsey Graham using the Nixon precedent about Congress alone to find Congress alone as a reason to have articles of impeachment well things do change mr. Graham is one of Donald Trump's chief defenders and of course he knows he's in Congress still there is major defiance of congressional subpoenas and the Clinton impeachment hearings we checked they lasted roughly two months assure committee also heard and this would be in the Trump example you'd imagine the president's lawyer stepping forward at the time it was Clinton's lawyer who stepped forward by the close of tomorrow all the world will see one simple and undeniable fact whatever there is in the record that shows that what the president did was wrong and blameworthy there is nothing in the record in either the law or the facts that would justify his impeachment and removal from office that was part of the fair process letting the president's lawyer state that view but the committee at the time led by Republicans did not agree they improved impeachment articles within days which led to another historic vote in the full House of Representatives William Jefferson Clinton is now the first elected president to be impeached by the house the second president in all of history he says he will stay on the job while his fate is already lying before the US Senate\n",
