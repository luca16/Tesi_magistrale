tonight history on the hill as House Democrats make their case against President Trump in the first public impeachment hearing in twenty years is this what Americans should now expect from their president if this is not impeachable conduct what is Democrats relying on to top career diplomats to spell out a quid pro quo much of the focus on that July phone call where President Trump asked Ukraine's president Solinsky for investigations into the Biden's and the 2016 election but tonight Taylor revealed another conversation involving President Trump the next day that he says a staffer recently told him about with Trump donor turned diplomat Gordon Sunland the member of my staff could hear President Trump on the phone asking ambassador Sandlin about the investigations master Sandlin told President Trump the Ukrainians were ready to move forward following the call with President Trump the member of my staff asked ambassador's son and what President Trump thought about Ukraine master song and responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden it's a call song whenever mentioned in his own testimony and a conversation getting to the heart of the Democrats argument that military aid to Ukraine and a coveted White House meeting were being withheld until Ukraine publicly announced the investigation into the president's political rival neither of these investigations was in the US national interest both however were in Donald Trump's personal interest have you ever seen another example of foreign aid conditioned on the personal or political interests of the President of the United States no mr. gagal have not the hearing testy at times you yourself mr. chairman have mischaracterized the call in fact in the first open hearing the suspect had a parody gentlewoman will suspend with Republicans from the start denouncing the entire episode as a partisan sham I'd like to congratulate you for passing the Democrat star chamber editions held for the last weeks in the basement of the Capitol it seems you agreed witting or unwitting Lee to participate in a drama but the main performance the Russia hoax has ended and you've been cast in the low-rent Ukrainian sequel Taylor going back one week before that July phone call recalling a videoconference where he says he sat in astonishment when an unidentified budget office staffer said the aid to Ukraine had been frozen without explaining why all that the OMB staff person said was that the directive had come from the president to the chief of staff to OMB in an instant I realized that one of the key pillars of our strong support for Ukraine was threatened and weeks after that call Taylor recounting this conversation with Gordon Sunland ambassador Solomon told me that President Trump had told him that he wants president szalinski to state publicly that Ukraine will investigate Berisha and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election ambassador Salman said everything was dependent on such an announcement including security assistance he said that President Trump wanted president Solinsky in a public box by making a public statement about ordering such investigations senior State Department official George can't also questioning the role of the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani Giuliani's efforts to gin up politically motivated investigations we're now infecting u.s. engagement with Ukraine leveraging president solinsky's desire for a White House meeting but Republicans defended the president where is the impeachable offense in that call saying he could not be threatening to withhold military aid because Taylor testified Ukraine did not know aid was being withheld until weeks after that July call and that ultimately the aid was given to Ukraine without the investigations president Trump requested were you wrong when you said you had a clear understanding that president Solinsky had to commit to an investigation of biden's before the aid got released and the a got released and he didn't commit to an investigation mister I was not wrong about what I told you which is what I heard that's all I've said I've told you what I heard and that's the point what you heard did not happen it didn't happen you didn't listen on president Trump's call and president lessees call either table you've never talked with chief of staff Mulvane I never did you never met the president that's correct this is what I can't believe and you're their star witness Republicans also defending president Trump's push to investigate hunter Biden who was given a job with the Ukrainian company BER yzma while Joe Biden was vice president something Kent questioned back in 2015 I raised my concern that hunter Biden's status as a board member would create the perception of a conflict of interests let me be clear however I did not witness any effort by any US official to shield verismo from scrutiny both career diplomats saying they were not seeking the spotlight and pushing back against that early morning attack from President Trump that there never Trump errs mr. Kent are you a never Trump er I am a career non professional who serves whatever president is duly elected and I've done that for 27 years for three Republican presidents and two Democrat presidents ambassador Taylor are you and never Trump er no sir the question tonight will any of this sway divided Americans testifying Friday the former ambassador to Ukraine and just added the State Department official who overheard that newly revealed call with President Trump he will testify behind closed doors a NBC News fans thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down here and click on any of the videos over here to watch the latest interviews show highlights and digital exclusives thanks for watching
