    "DOCUMENT" : "but as the story evolves in this way and ahead of tomorrow's second impeachment hearing I think it's also just worth articulating the existence of the elephant in the room here right because I know this is basic and I know you know it but I feel like it's easy to lose sight of as we head into the second public impeachment hearing here I mean there's a reason that when the whistleblower complaint was first filed that bit about holding up the military aid to Ukraine that was filed separately in a classified appendix I mean the whistleblower knew that even if that complaint was getting delivered to Congress which is what he or she wanted still this bit about the military aid to Ukraine being held up the whistleblower took steps to try to make sure that that was treated with special care that the president's ordered a hold up military aid to Ukraine would be handled as sensitive classified information that would be held tighter it'd be restricted more the fewer people would see that right why would the whistleblower want to make sure that that part of what the whistleblower was alleging this incredibly a flama Tory allegation that the whistleblower is making about the President of the United States committing clearly impeachable and illegal acts in office to benefit himself politically at the expense of US national security and our allies I mean the whistleblower is willing to say a lot on page one of that complaint but that bit about the president holding up military a do you cry and keep that classified why should that be kept more quiet but we have since learned in this education we've all had as civilians watching these impeachment proceedings roll out as we've learned from these witnesses who are experts in this field we have since learned from them but the reason you'd want to keep something like that as quiet as possible is because among other things that becoming public knowledge it becoming known around the world that US military aid to Ukraine was being held up that itself is a damaging thing to Ukraine not just them losing the aid which hurts them materially but everybody knowing that their aid was in jeopardy that it was being held up by the American president that itself incurs damage Ukrainians would like to be able to negotiate from a from a of strength or at least more strength than they now have part of that strength part of the ability of the Ukrainians to negotiate against the Russians with the Russians for for an end to the war in Davos depends on United States and other international support if we withdraw or suspend or or threaten to withdraw our security systems that's a message to the Ukrainians but it's at least as important as your question indicates mr. chairman to the Russians who are looking for any sign of weakness or any sign that we are withdrawing our support for Ukraine the Russians are looking for any sign of weakness any sign that we are withdrawing our support for Ukraine so if it becomes known that that support is threatened that itself hurts Ukraine that benefits Russia alright the president was holding up aid to Ukraine to try to pressure them to cook up these investigations to help him against the Democrats in 2020 but in using Ukraine that way and in putting on ice hundreds of millions of dollars of US aid to them he hurt them he hurt their national security he specifically as bill Taylor just explained there yesterday he hurt their negotiating position visa v Russia with whom they are in a war right now which means Russia benefits from chump doing that from from Trump withholding that military aid Russia benefits from that because it shows that Ukraine doesn't have the kind of American and international support that Ukraine might have thought they had and so they're weaker than everybody thought they were they're more at Russia's mercy right even with the military aid now being forced to be released because of this scandal that's how this thing is shaking out now in terms of who benefits quote in the past American diplomats worked closely with Kiev in any talks with Moscow they presented a united front to the Kremlin that could Joel the European Union to maintain sanctions they tried to reassure a nervous Ukrainian public but now the United States is largely absent from the political and diplomatic process over resolving the war in the east the leader of one pro US political party in new Rane telling The Washington Post today quote Ukraine is now kind of naked we are alone confronting Russia david ignatius at the excuse me I was in The New York Times not the Washington Post David Ignatius in the Washington Post raising much the same alarm today trump's ukraine massa nations have yielded the diminution of u.s. power and a corresponding increase in russia's military and diplomatic leverage the united states was an important backup for ukraine losing that support puts kiev in a weaker bargaining position visa v Russia how is the United States shaping events as Ukraine is rebalance now America isn't really a player Trump said in September while meeting zalenski in New York quote I really hope that you and President Putin can get together and solve your problem yeah we know we used to be your ally your most important ally we know we used to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with you so you never felt like you had to face Russia alone but now you're alone good luck against Putin now see what you can work out with him then get back to me if it works out and maybe you'll get a White House visit otherwise maybe not I mean we we are in the middle of this impeachment now and it is still unfolding and there is still more to learn and tomorrow is going to be tomorrow should be a big deal even just the news tonight is a big deal but even after only one day of public hearings so far I mean the elephant in the room here feels like it's roar rearing up and stomping its feet because who benefits with all of these things that Trump has done with all of them with all the stuff in the middle of the impeachment but all the other stuff he's doing simultaneously I mean it wasn't just pressure on Ukraine to cough up investigations against Joe Biden right it was withholding military aid withholding the military aid letting it be known that their military aid was in question that alone disadvantages Ukraine in their hot war fight against Russia benefit to Russia the u.s. special envoy to Ukraine which who's specifically tasked to help Ukraine and its war in its negotiations against Russia that was this guy Kurt Volker who resigned when he was called in to testify in the impeachment proceedings we've just learned that the Trump administration just isn't going to fill that job now that Volker resigned from it getting rid of that job now no more dedicated US envoy for helping Ukraine in their war with Russia I'm sure Russia is delighted by that too we learned from the testimony of Foreign Service Officer Christopher Anderson whose testimony has been released in\n",

right because I know this is basic and I know you know it but I feel like it's easy to lose sight of as we head into the second public impeachment hearing here I mean there's a reason that when the whistleblower complaint was first filed that bit about holding up the military aid to Ukraine that was filed separately in a classified appendix I mean the whistleblower knew that even if that complaint was getting delivered to Congress which is what he or she wanted still this bit about the military aid to Ukraine being held up the whistleblower took steps to try to make sure that that was treated with special care that the president's ordered a hold up military aid to Ukraine would be handled as sensitive classified information that would be held tighter it'd be restricted more the fewer people would see that right why would the whistleblower want to make sure that that part of what the whistleblower was alleging this incredibly a flama Tory allegation that the whistleblower is making about the President of the United States committing clearly impeachable and illegal acts in office to benefit himself politically at the expense of US national security and our allies I mean the whistleblower is willing to say a lot on page one of that complaint but that bit about the president holding up military a do you cry and keep that classified why should that be kept more quiet but we have since learned in this education we've all had as civilians watching these impeachment proceedings roll out as we've learned from these witnesses who are experts in this field we have since learned from them but the reason you'd want to keep something like that as quiet as possible is because among other things that becoming public knowledge it becoming known around the world that US military aid to Ukraine was being held up that itself is a damaging thing to Ukraine not just them losing the aid which hurts them materially but everybody knowing that their aid was in jeopardy that it was being held up by the American president that itself incurs damage Ukrainians would like to be able to negotiate from a from a of strength or at least more strength than they now have part of that strength part of the ability of the Ukrainians to negotiate against the Russians with the Russians for for an end to the war in Davos depends on United States and other international support if we withdraw or suspend or or threaten to withdraw our security systems that's a message to the Ukrainians but it's at least as important as your question indicates mr. chairman to the Russians who are looking for any sign of weakness or any sign that we are withdrawing our support for Ukraine the Russians are looking for any sign of weakness any sign that we are withdrawing our support for Ukraine so if it becomes known that that support is threatened that itself hurts Ukraine that benefits Russia alright the president was holding up aid to Ukraine to try to pressure them to cook up these investigations to help him against the Democrats in 2020 but in using Ukraine that way and in putting on ice hundreds of millions of dollars of US aid to them he hurt them he hurt their national security he specifically as bill Taylor just explained there yesterday he hurt their negotiating position visa v Russia with whom they are in a war right now which means Russia benefits from chump doing that from from Trump withholding that military aid Russia benefits from that because it shows that Ukraine doesn't have the kind of American and international support that Ukraine might have thought they had and so they're weaker than everybody thought they were they're more at Russia's mercy right even with the military aid now being forced to be released because of this scandal that's how this thing is shaking out now in terms of who benefits quote in the past American diplomats worked closely with Kiev in any talks with Moscow they presented a united front to the Kremlin that could Joel the European Union to maintain sanctions they tried to reassure a nervous Ukrainian public but now the United States is largely absent from the political and diplomatic process over resolving the war in the east the leader of one pro US political party in new Rane telling The Washington Post today quote Ukraine is now kind of naked we are alone confronting Russia david ignatius at the excuse me I was in The New York Times not the Washington Post David Ignatius in the Washington Post raising much the same alarm today trump's ukraine massa nations have yielded the diminution of u.s. power and a corresponding increase in russia's military and diplomatic leverage the united states was an important backup for ukraine losing that support puts kiev in a weaker bargaining position visa v Russia how is the United States shaping events as Ukraine is rebalance now America isn't really a player Trump said in September while meeting zalenski in New York quote I really hope that you and President Putin can get together and solve your problem yeah we know we used to be your ally your most important ally we know we used to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with you so you never felt like you had to face Russia alone but now you're alone good luck against Putin now see what you can work out with him then get back to me if it works out and maybe you'll get a White House visit otherwise maybe not I mean we we are in the middle of this impeachment now and it is still unfolding and there is still more to learn and tomorrow is going to be tomorrow should be a big deal even just the news tonight is a big deal but even after only one day of public hearings so far I mean the elephant in the room here feels like it's roar rearing up and stomping its feet because who benefits with all of these things that Trump has done with all of them with all the stuff in the middle of the impeachment but all the other stuff he's doing simultaneously I mean it wasn't just pressure on Ukraine to cough up investigations against Joe Biden right it was withholding military aid withholding the military aid letting it be known that their military aid was in question that alone disadvantages Ukraine in their hot war fight against Russia benefit to Russia the u.s. special envoy to Ukraine which who's specifically tasked to help Ukraine and its war in its negotiations against Russia that was this guy Kurt Volker who resigned when he was called in to testify in the impeachment proceedings we've just learned that the Trump administration just isn't going to fill that job now that Volker resigned from it getting rid of that job now no more dedicated US envoy for helping Ukraine in their war with Russia I'm sure Russia is delighted by that too we learned from the

right because I know this is basic and I know you know it but I feel like it's easy to lose sight of as we head into the second public impeachment hearing here I mean there's a reason that when the whistleblower complaint was first filed that bit about holding up the military aid to Ukraine that was filed separately in a classified appendix I mean the whistleblower knew that even if that complaint was getting delivered to Congress which is what he or she wanted still this bit about the military aid to Ukraine being held up the whistleblower took steps to try to make sure that that was treated with special care that the president's ordered a hold up military aid to Ukraine would be handled as sensitive classified information that would be held tighter it'd be restricted more the fewer people would see that right why would the whistleblower want to make sure that that part of what the whistleblower was alleging this incredibly a flama Tory allegation that the whistleblower is making about the President of the United States committing clearly impeachable and illegal acts in office to benefit himself politically at the expense of US national security and our allies I mean the whistleblower is willing to say a lot on page one of that complaint but that bit about the president holding up military a do you cry and keep that classified why should that be kept more quiet but we have since learned in this education we've all had as civilians watching these impeachment proceedings roll out as we've learned from these witnesses who are experts in this field we have since learned from them but the reason you'd want to keep something like that as quiet as possible is because among other things that becoming public knowledge it becoming known around the world that US military aid to Ukraine was being held up that itself is a damaging thing to Ukraine not just them losing the aid which hurts them materially but everybody knowing that their aid was in jeopardy that it was being held up by the American president that itself incurs damage Ukrainians would like to be able to negotiate from a from a of strength or at least more strength than they now have part of that strength part of the ability of the Ukrainians to negotiate against the Russians with the Russians for for an end to the war in Davos depends on United States and other international support if we withdraw or suspend or or threaten to withdraw our security systems that's a message to the Ukrainians but it's at least as important as your question indicates mr. chairman to the Russians who are looking for any sign of weakness or any sign that we are withdrawing our support for Ukraine the Russians are looking for any sign of weakness any sign that we are withdrawing our support for Ukraine so if it becomes known that that support is threatened that itself hurts Ukraine that benefits Russia alright the president was holding up aid to Ukraine to try to pressure them to cook up these investigations to help him against the Democrats in 2020 but in using Ukraine that way and in putting on ice hundreds of millions of dollars of US aid to them he hurt them he hurt their national security he specifically as bill Taylor just explained there yesterday he hurt their negotiating position visa v Russia with whom they are in a war right now which means Russia benefits from chump doing that from from Trump withholding that military aid Russia benefits from that because it shows that Ukraine doesn't have the kind of American and international support that Ukraine might have thought they had and so they're weaker than everybody thought they were they're more at Russia's mercy right even with the military aid now being forced to be released because of this scandal that's how this thing is shaking out now in terms of who benefits quote in the past American diplomats worked closely with Kiev in any talks with Moscow they presented a united front to the Kremlin that could Joel the European Union to maintain sanctions they tried to reassure a nervous Ukrainian public but now the United States is largely absent from the political and diplomatic process over resolving the war in the east the leader of one pro US political party in new Rane telling The Washington Post today quote Ukraine is now kind of naked we are alone confronting Russia david ignatius at the excuse me I was in The New York Times not the Washington Post David Ignatius in the Washington Post raising much the same alarm today trump's ukraine massa nations have yielded the diminution of u.s. power and a corresponding increase in russia's military and diplomatic leverage the united states was an important backup for ukraine losing that support puts kiev in a weaker bargaining position visa v Russia how is the United States shaping events as Ukraine is rebalance now America isn't really a player Trump said in September while meeting zalenski in New York quote I really hope that you and President Putin can get together and solve your problem yeah we know we used to be your ally your most important ally we know we used to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with you so you never felt like you had to face Russia alone but now you're alone good luck against Putin now see what you can work out with him then get back to me if it works out and maybe you'll get a White House visit otherwise maybe not I mean we we are in the middle of this impeachment now and it is still unfolding and there is still more to learn and tomorrow is going to be tomorrow should be a big deal even just the news tonight is a big deal but even after only one day of public hearings so far I mean the elephant in the room here feels like it's roar rearing up and stomping its feet because who benefits with all of these things that Trump has done with all of them with all the stuff in the middle of the impeachment but all the other stuff he's doing simultaneously I mean it wasn't just pressure on Ukraine to cough up investigations against Joe Biden right it was withholding military aid withholding the military aid letting it be known that their military aid was in question that alone disadvantages Ukraine in their hot war fight against Russia benefit to Russia the u.s. special envoy to Ukraine which who's specifically tasked to help Ukraine and its war in its negotiations against Russia that was this guy Kurt Volker who resigned when he was called in to testify in the impeachment proceedings we've just learned that the Trump administration just isn't going to fill that job now that Volker resigned from it getting rid of that job now no more dedicated US envoy for helping Ukraine in their war with Russia I'm sure Russia is delighted by that too we learned from the

it was being held up by the American president that itself incurs damage Ukrainians would like to be able to negotiate from a from a of strength or at least more strength than they now have part of that strength part of the ability of the Ukrainians to negotiate against the Russians with the Russians for for an end to the war in Davos depends on United States and other international support if we withdraw or suspend or or threaten to withdraw our security systems that's a message to the Ukrainians but it's at least as important as your question indicates mr. chairman to the Russians who are looking for any sign of weakness or any sign that we are withdrawing our support for Ukraine the Russians are looking for any sign of weakness any sign that we are withdrawing our support for Ukraine so if it becomes known that that support is threatened that itself hurts Ukraine that benefits Russia alright the president was holding up aid to Ukraine to try to pressure them to cook up these investigations to help him against the Democrats in 2020 but in using Ukraine that way and in putting on ice hundreds of millions of dollars of US aid to them he hurt them he hurt their national security he specifically as bill Taylor just explained there yesterday he hurt their negotiating position visa v Russia with whom they are in a war right now which means Russia benefits from chump doing that from from Trump withholding that military aid Russia benefits from that because it shows that Ukraine doesn't have the kind of American and international support that Ukraine might have thought they had and so they're weaker than everybody thought they were they're more at Russia's mercy right even with the military aid now being forced to be released because of this scandal that's how this thing is shaking out now in terms of who benefits quote in the past American diplomats worked closely with Kiev in any talks with Moscow they presented a united front to the Kremlin that could Joel the European Union to maintain sanctions they tried to reassure a nervous Ukrainian public but now the United States is largely absent from the political and diplomatic process over resolving the war in the east the leader of one pro US political party in new Rane telling The Washington Post today quote Ukraine is now kind of naked we are alone confronting Russia david ignatius at the excuse me I was in The New York Times not the Washington Post David Ignatius in the Washington Post raising much the same alarm today trump's ukraine massa nations have yielded the diminution of u.s. power and a corresponding increase in russia's military and diplomatic leverage the united states was an important backup for ukraine losing that support puts kiev in a weaker bargaining position visa v Russia how is the United States shaping events as Ukraine is rebalance now America isn't really a player Trump said in September while meeting zalenski in New York quote I really hope that you and President Putin can get together and solve your problem yeah we know we used to be your ally your most important ally we know we used to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with you so you never felt like you had to face Russia alone but now you're alone good luck against Putin now see what you can work out with him then get back to me if it works out and maybe you'll get a White House visit otherwise maybe not I mean we we are in the middle of this impeachment now and it is still unfolding and there is still more to learn and tomorrow is going to be tomorrow should be a big deal even just the news tonight is a big deal but even after only one day of public hearings so far I mean the elephant in the room here feels like it's roar rearing up and stomping its feet because who benefits with all of these things that Trump has done with all of them with all the stuff in the middle of the impeachment but all the other stuff he's doing simultaneously I mean it wasn't just pressure on Ukraine to cough up investigations against Joe Biden right it was withholding military aid withholding the military aid letting it be known that their military aid was in question that alone disadvantages Ukraine in their hot war fight against Russia benefit to Russia the u.s. special envoy to Ukraine which who's specifically tasked to help Ukraine and its war in its negotiations against Russia that was this guy Kurt Volker who resigned when he was called in to testify in the impeachment proceedings we've just learned that the Trump administration just isn't going to fill that job now that Volker resigned from it getting rid of that job now no more dedicated US envoy for helping Ukraine in their war with Russia I'm sure Russia is delighted by that too we learned from the
