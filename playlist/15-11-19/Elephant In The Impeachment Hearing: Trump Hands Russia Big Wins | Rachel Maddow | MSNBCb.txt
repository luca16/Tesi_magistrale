transcript form we learned from him that when Russia attacked Ukrainian ships and took a whole bunch of Ukrainian sailors prisoner this time last year the Trump White House blocked a statement of condemnation from being issued against Russia for having done that why did the Trump White House block a statement condemning Russia seizing Ukrainian ships and stealing Ukrainian sailors Trump White House blocked that benefit to Russia we learned from Andersen as well that when a CNN story ran last year about the u.s. Navy doing an exercise in the Black Sea that was portrayed as the US military standing up to Russia in the black sea president Trump's saw that report and called national security advisor John Bolton at home to tell Bolton how upset he was by that report and in response the White House ordered the Navy to not do that exercise in the black sea wouldn't want to upset Russia we learned from national security council staffer Catherine Croft whose testimony has also been released in transcript form but even after the Trump administration set a new policy that Ukraine would get javelin missiles from the US and everybody in the administration signed off on that policy in the State Department in the Defense Department everybody else National Security Council everybody's on board the White House specifically intervened with a late hold on those missiles why what was the right house concerned about according to Catherine Croft quote that Russia would react negatively to the provision of javelins to Ukraine yes we can't have that I mean on the day that President Trump was what promising that he definitely wasn't watching his first impeachment hearing that day the president Erdogan of Turkey is at the White House yesterday and that relationship is weird and inexplicable enough but when Trump does Iran this favor right and precipitously pulls US troops out of northeastern Syria in a phone call third one he decides is going to do that he does it the immediate result is that Turkey and Russia come in to take over that land that our allies and US Special Forces had been holding in northeastern Syria the US base there literally now has the American base there now has a Russian flag flying over it and Russian soldiers are now using that base and Russian soldiers are now patrolling that part of the country where US troops and US allies were removed by president Trump's actions we're out here Putin you can have it Turkey has also just bought Russian anti-aircraft weapons turkey is a member of NATO having a NATO member by advanced Russian weapon systems is a huge military coup for Russia and it is a crisis for NATO I mean not to get into the technicalities of it but giving and having a NATO member operating a sophisticated Russian anti-aircraft missile system like this potentially exposes the most secret u.s. fighter jet technology to the Russians thanks Turkey thanks for doing that Republican senators who were upset by that and who are upset by Turkish militarist military attacking our allies in Syria president Trump weighed in dirt waited in during this White House visit to try to smooth that all over to try to calm down Republican senators about that to try to make it okay for Turkey so it's okay that they attacked our allies and it's okay that they've got to keep those sophisticated Russian weapons Trump wants Turkey to keep those sophisticated Russian weapons regardless of what that means for US military superiority and for NATO advantage Russia I mean even the core weirdness at the heart of the impeachment Trump didn't just ask Ukraine to announce bogus investigations into Joe Biden right remember what else he asked Ukraine to investigate he asked them to investigate 2016 specifically this weird conspiracy theory that it wasn't Russia that messed with our elections in 2016 it was Ukraine messing with our elections with David Sanger in the new york times tonight calls one of the many odd twists in the partisan noise around the impeachment president Trump's effort to divert attention from suspicions about the 2016 hack away from Russia he calls it a completely discredited theory that Ukrainian hackers not Russia's military intelligence were responsible for the hack well where did this completely discredited theory come from it was Ukraine that meddled in the 2016 election and not Russia I mean all of us intelligence and the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee concludes without any equivocation it was Russia who messed with us the president is advancing this theory that instead it wasn't Russia it was Ukraine Ukraine did it where does that come from we actually now have an origin story for where that came from the recently release this is just recently released by a court order recently released FBI interview notes with Trump's deputy campaign chair Rick gates gives us our earliest known appearance of that weird conspiracy theory in the wild from the FBI interview notes with Rick gates quote gates recalled Paul Manafort saying the hack was likely carried out by the Ukrainians not the Russians why did man afford say that that quote parroted a narrative that columbic often supported columbic konstantin columbic that's the person who was saying that it was Ukraine not Russia that's where Paul Manafort got it from who's Konstantin columbic Konstantin columbic is the guy who Manafort worked for worked with for years in Ukraine Konstantin columbic who came out of Russian military intelligence who the FBI assesses is still linked to Russian military intelligence so this whole thing that the president and the White House and Republicans in Congress now are actively promoting this conspiracy theory that Russia didn't intervene in the 2016 election it was Ukraine who did that that theory appears to have originated with the GRU with Russian military intelligence with a Russian military intelligence guy who delivered it to the president's campaign chair who is in prison for laundering and not paying taxes on the millions of dollars he took from pro-kremlin political allies and and political parties in Ukraine I mean the president is now promoting the conspiracy theory that Russia didn't intervene in the election at all it was Ukraine that theory is from Russian military intelligence I mean I know this impeachment inquiry is about one specific thing that the president did about Ukraine and it is about that for a reason I it's proven that he did it he's admitted that he's done it it's illegal and impeachable and he's gonna get impeached for it I get it but literally everything he is doing here including the core allegations at the heart of the impeachment all just happen to benefit Russia all just happened to redound to the benefit of russia all of them and maybe that is a huge coincidence but I mean what do we do with that look at some help with that
