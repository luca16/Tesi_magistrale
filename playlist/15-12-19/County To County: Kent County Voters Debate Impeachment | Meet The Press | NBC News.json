    "DOCUMENT" : "you heard us reference what is the rest of America think about all this well impeachment is dominating the conversation here in Washington but we have been wondering just how much voters beyond the beltway care about the hearings in Capitol Hill so we traveled to Kent County Michigan it's part of our year-long County to County project or file following five key counties in five swing states that we believe will be the most competitive in 2020 and for us Kent County is everything so we traveled there home to Grand Rapids my colleague Dante Chinni here of NBC News and The Wall Street Journal he sat down at a brewery vivants with six voters all Republicans most of whom voted for President Trump in 2016 we wanted to know whether they're following impeachment as closely as we are here's some of what we found I don't even care about it's just noise um have you ever recorded a football game but found out the final score before you watched it then you just won't even care so I know you know what's going to happen the house will vote articles of impeachment the Senate will probably acquit and so you know what it's already baked in so it's just not interesting I'm thinking it's a done deal with the house and I agree that you know the Senate will overturn that or vote not to we're not hearing people talk about it in my circle at all I think everyone pretty much knows where everyone else stands and you know they're just not interested they don't have the time to try to follow it it is a complicated story is it do you think it's to do you think is that it's too complicated for people to follow me there's a lot of ins and outs no I think it's fairly straightforward I think a lot of people see it more as an infomercial politically and it's it's very different than like looking back on the Nixon impeachment which was really really grave at the time was by the vote very bipartisan and this just seems like it really is political theater I still think it's it's merited to understand whether ornot the president directed a quid pro quo with Ukraine and all the different things that are surrounding this investigation it felt like for a minute there was a split second leading up to the somnolent earings where it felt like there was momentum or maybe it wasn't a done deal maybe there was more to be uncovered and then the second half of Salman'stestimony was completed and it felt like everything just stopped we plateaued and then it began to again feel like the game was already finished and we were watching a a predetermined process that was going to be played for political gain on both sides I think we're looking at the Republicans posturing themselves the president and tweeting for example I don't think those are accidents I think we create purpose II tweets at 2:00 a.m. to drive the next orning news cycle he doesn't win a lot of style points no knows how to play the social media political process so I was saying earlier that through the holiday season getting together with people nobody's talking about it I think people are just tired they see it as a political hit it is very partisan and if it's not one thing it's going to be another it's going to be another it's going to be another does his have any effect on anybody's presidential vote in 2020 one way or the other I wouldn't think so cuz we knew who Trump was when when they voted for him so it's not it's already been it's already baked in I don't think this is shaking the pillars of democracy such that it warrants impeachment I think my vote is more affected by the current economics situation and balancing that against frankly Trump's personality which is not the best I was going to say for me it's beyond trunk Trump will come and go worst case scenario for some right 2024 and I still believe that Republican answers are the answers to solve some of our country's problems social economic political policies so I would not necessarily Matt Trump voter but I think the Republican Party has the best set of answers Cindy you ave a you have a term for what how you describe your own politics and I'm a repulsed Republican I much believe in the Republican values and you know we we need a strong economy we have to support their businesses I'm pro-life I believe in a strong military I believe in all of that I also believe that we can do better in how we're anaging our money that debt that debt is soaring and you know to hear Mitch McConnell say that they will become the fiscal conservative party when they get a Democrat in the office tells me one thing and it tells tells me we don't matter out here did president Trump I know where there's a difference of pinion on the table about whether it's impeachment were they did President Trump do anything wrong when you look at when you look at well sure if they're anything in the impeachment car you look at and say this these are the things you do with Ukraine these things shouldn't ave happened I would like clarification as to his question on the phone call was it referencing back to 2016 and asking for information from Ukraine or was it referencing the upcoming election and that's not clear to me if it's back to 2016 hat's not impeach evil right I agree and and do we owe Ukraine money were we gifting Ukraine money were we lending Ukraine money who gives money without some kind of I don't want to call it quid pro quo but I mean some kind of you know here ut hey well I'm giving you this I heard about a problem back then can you look into that is that unweighting problems Trump is it has he earned the benefit of the doubt he squandered it so often it's unlikely that he's innocent well wouldn't you say wrong I'm trying to hurry are you saying llegal are you saying inappropriate or impeachment and high crimes and misdemeanors that call when I listen tothem I'm thinking what are they what are they so upset about where do we go what would you like to see happen with this I'm

Wall Street Journal he sat down at a brewery vivants with six voters all Republicans most of whom voted for President Trump in 2016 we wanted to know whether they're following impeachment as closely as we are here's some of what we found I don't even care about it's just noise um have you ever recorded a football game but found out the final score before you watched it then you just won't even care so I know you know what's going to happen the house will vote articles of impeachment the Senate will probably acquit and so you know what it's already baked in so it's just not interesting I'm thinking it's a done deal with the house and I agree that you know the Senate will overturn that or vote not to we're not hearing people talk about it in my circle at all I think everyone pretty much knows where everyone else stands and you know they're just not interested they don't have the time to try to follow it it is a complicated story is it do you think it's to do you think is that it's too complicated for people to follow me there's a lot of ins and outs no I think it's fairly straightforward I think a lot of people see it more as an infomercial politically and it's it's very different than like looking back on the Nixon impeachment which was really really grave at the time was by the vote very bipartisan and this just seems like it really is political theater I still think it's it's merited to understand whether ornot the president directed a quid pro quo with Ukraine and all the different things that are surrounding this investigation it felt like for a minute there was a split second leading up to the somnolent earings where it felt like there was momentum or maybe it wasn't a done deal maybe there was more to be uncovered and then the second half of Salman'stestimony was completed and it felt like everything just stopped we plateaued and then it began to again feel like the game was already finished and we were watching a a predetermined process that was going to be played for political gain on both sides I think we're looking at the Republicans posturing themselves the president and tweeting for example I don't think those are accidents I think we create purpose II tweets at 2:00 a.m. to drive the next orning news cycle he doesn't win a lot of style points no knows how to play the social media political process so I was saying earlier that through the holiday season getting together with people nobody's talking about it I think people are just tired they see it as a political hit it is very partisan and if it's not one thing it's going to be another it's going to be another it's going to be another does his have any effect on anybody's presidential vote in 2020 one way or the other I wouldn't think so cuz we knew who Trump was when when they voted for him so it's not it's already been it's already baked in I don't think this is shaking the pillars of democracy such that it warrants impeachment I think my vote is more affected by the current economics situation and balancing that against frankly Trump's personality which is not the best I was going to say for me it's beyond trunk Trump will come and go worst case scenario for some right 2024 and I still believe that Republican answers are the answers to solve some of our country's problems social economic political policies so I would not necessarily Matt Trump voter but I think the Republican Party has the best set of answers Cindy you ave a you have a term for what how you describe your own politics and I'm a repulsed Republican I much believe in the Republican values and you know we we need a strong economy we have to support their businesses I'm pro-life I believe in a strong military I believe in all of that I also believe that we can do better in how we're anaging our money that debt that debt is soaring and you know to hear Mitch McConnell say that they will become the fiscal conservative party when they get a Democrat in the office tells me one thing and it tells tells me we don't matter out here did president Trump I know where there's a difference of pinion on the table about whether it's impeachment were they did President Trump do anything wrong when you look at when you look at well sure if they're anything in the impeachment car you look at and say this these are the things you do with Ukraine these things shouldn't ave happened I would like clarification as to his question on the phone call was it referencing back to 2016 and asking for information from Ukraine or was it referencing the upcoming election and that's not clear to me if it's back to 2016 hat's not impeach evil right I agree and and do we owe Ukraine money were we gifting Ukraine money were we lending Ukraine money who gives money without some kind of I don't want to call it quid pro quo but I mean some kind of you know here ut hey well I'm giving you this I heard about a problem back then can you look into that is that unweighting problems Trump is it has he earned the benefit of the doubt he squandered it so often it's unlikely that he's innocent well wouldn't you say wrong I'm trying to hurry are you saying llegal are you saying

think it's it's merited to understand whether ornot the president directed a quid pro quo with Ukraine and all the different things that are surrounding this investigation it felt like for a minute there was a split second leading up to the somnolent earings where it felt like there was momentum or maybe it wasn't a done deal maybe there was more to be uncovered and then the second half of Salman'stestimony was completed and it felt like everything just stopped we plateaued and then it began to again feel like the game was already finished and we were watching a a predetermined process that was going to be played for political gain on both sides I think we're looking at the Republicans posturing themselves the president and tweeting for example I don't think those are accidents I think we create purpose II tweets at 2:00 a.m. to drive the next orning news cycle he doesn't win a lot of style points no knows how to play the social media political process so I was saying earlier that through the holiday season getting together with people nobody's talking about it I think people are just tired they see it as a political hit it is very partisan and if it's not one thing it's going to be another it's going to be another it's going to be another does his have any effect on anybody's presidential vote in 2020 one way or the other I wouldn't think so cuz we knew who Trump was when when they voted for him so it's not it's already been it's already baked in I don't think this is shaking the pillars of democracy such that it warrants impeachment I think my vote is more affected by the current economics situation and balancing that against frankly Trump's personality which is not the best I was going to say for me it's beyond trunk Trump will come and go worst case scenario for some right 2024 and I still believe that Republican answers are the answers to solve some of our country's problems social economic political policies so I would not necessarily Matt Trump voter but I think the Republican Party has the best set of answers Cindy you ave a you have a term for what how you describe your own politics and I'm a repulsed Republican I much believe in the Republican values and you know we we need a strong economy we have to support their businesses I'm pro-life I believe in a strong military I believe in all of that I also believe that we can do better in how we're anaging our money that debt that debt is soaring and you know to hear Mitch McConnell say that they will become the fiscal conservative party when they get a Democrat in the office tells me one thing and it tells tells me we don't matter out here did president Trump I know where there's a difference of pinion on the table about whether it's impeachment were they did President Trump do anything wrong when you look at when you look at well sure if they're anything in the impeachment car you look at and say this these are the things you do with Ukraine these things shouldn't ave happened I would like clarification as to his question on the phone call was it referencing back to 2016 and asking for information from Ukraine or was it referencing the upcoming election and that's not clear to me if it's back to 2016 hat's not impeach evil right I agree and and do we owe Ukraine money were we gifting Ukraine money were we lending Ukraine money who gives money without some kind of I don't want to call it quid pro quo but I mean some kind of you know here ut hey well I'm giving you this I heard about a problem back then can you look into that is that unweighting problems Trump is it has he earned the benefit of the doubt he squandered it so often it's unlikely that he's innocent well wouldn't you say wrong I'm trying to hurry are you saying llegal are you saying inappropriate or impeachment and high crimes and misdemeanors that call when I listen tothem I'm thinking what are they what are they so upset about where do we go what would you like to see happen

        "SENTENCE_TEXT" : "you heard us reference what is the rest of America think about all this well impeachment is dominating the conversation here in Washington but we have been wondering just how much voters beyond the beltway care about the hearings in Capitol Hill so we traveled to Kent County Michigan it's part of our year-long County to County project or file following five key counties in five swing states that we believe will be the most competitive in 2020 and for us Kent County is everything so we traveled there home to Grand Rapids my colleague Dante Chinni here of NBC News and The Wall Street Journal he sat down at a brewery vivants with six voters all Republicans most of whom voted for President Trump in 2016 we wanted to know whether they're following impeachment as closely as we are here's some of what we found I don't even care about it's just noise um have you ever recorded a football game but found out the final score before you watched it then you just won't even care so I know you know what's going to happen the house will vote articles of impeachment the Senate will probably acquit and so you know what it's already baked in so it's just not interesting I'm thinking it's a done deal with the house and I agree that you know the Senate will overturn that or vote not to we're not hearing people talk about it in my circle at all I think everyone pretty much knows where everyone else stands and you know they're just not interested they don't have the time to try to follow it it is a complicated story is it do you think it's to do you
