 welcome back panelists here Eddie Glaude jr. of Princeton University Danielle petka of the American Enterprise Institute NBC News correspondent Heidi Perez Bella and Peter Baker chief White House correspondent for the New York Times let me start with this Peter I'm sorry with rich Lowry ut you essentially wrote a had a similar theme to what rich wrote on Friday which is this what we open our show with never as history felt less consequential the Impa the impending impeachment of President Donald Trump is as news accounts and blaring newspaper headlines tell us historic this is a true buy this is true by definition since a president has been impeached only twice before in 230 years ultimately impeachment is going to get swallowed up by the news cycle like everything else yeah exactly I mean 21 years ago when they impeached President Bill Clinton it felt like that was the biggest story in the history of the world everything had stopped spinning on its axis for a while this just feels like another chapter in the Trump story we've been sort of at DEFCON 1 or where DEFCON 5 election day since three years of intensity non-stop hurricane gales you know force a conflict in Washington and this just feels like yet another chapter in that rather than something unique so I think that's where our role is the media is important to point out where we are take a pause this moment in history this president is about to become the first president in the history of this nation who will be impeached for violating one of the founders most primal fears which is inviting foreign involvement into our elections we all saw it we saw it on the South Lawn we saw it in the call summary so the only question now really is how the public is going to respond the outcome is preordained in the Senate he will be acquitted they may have a trial short trial long trail he'll be acquitted and then the question is a ear from now how our voters going to respond to that there's only one certainty and that is we're going to have more information coming out we've got all of these court cases winding their way through on his tax returns onall the documents from State Department and OMB that are being withheld we've not heard from any of the people who were in his immediate inner circle that could all change in a year and the question is going to be who's going to e more angry Trump's base who believes that he was exonerated or the democratic base who believes that he walked don't think  we know yet because it's also not gonna be the only factor it goes into the election you've set up though we're already in the Battle of the aftermath I feel like right Eddie and Danny daddy so you know one of the one thing I mean let's pan out for a minute just for a second the aftermath is that we're going to have a particular understanding of the executive branch its power if Trump survives this which he will write if it turns out that impeachment has no sting has no bite and we're in he aftermath what it will mean is that  there will be an unlimited and imperial executive branch that can do whatever it wants to do I don't know what Congress's power will look like so I'm just talking about at the level of checks we don't know what he will do with it either right he made also feel chagrin unlikely so the idea that was informing Federalist 51 the idea that informed the found our very system of checks and balances right I think is in question after this maybe that me I'm being hyperbolic but no I think that that imperial presidency should actually that ship sailed a while ago I really do I mean it was it was a problem under george w bush it was a growing problem under obama and it has come to its  apotheosis under under donald trump but I think what Heidi said I think is really important because I think you neatly although perhaps unintentionally Illustrated the divide between how you or perhaps even we see things here and how the rest of the world or the rest of America sees these things they're seeing you know what walk yeah okay we want to talk to john bolton we want to talk to Mulvaney we want those papers yet he definitely did it you know this is what he did he broke the founders most sacred you know most sacred vows about how our nation was to be run yeah that's not what a lot of people think and to the extent that they do they either agree or disagree but they're really not interested in all these details and i think that it occurred back to the media don't it goes further to the narrative that there's one side intent on persecuting the president and one side intent on not listening can i there's one other thing that's we have the party switch that's in the news today but the Democrat from New Jersey who's likel  gonna switch over this about threemonths ago yeah Justin Amash who switched let's think about this neither member of Congress thought they stay in their own party and criticize their party and disagree that you had to leave the tribe no matter what you had to leave the tribe that to me that the Democratic big tents not big enough for somebody to be against impeachment the Republican tent is not big enough to criticize this president and be for impeachment what is that I mean that means where it feels as if it's on irreconcilable differences our parties are more homogeneous than they used to be right districts are designed so that your biggest threat is a member of the House is not from the other party but from within your own party which with this Democratic congressman Democrats are leaking all this poll numbers say look this guy simply by not voting for the impeachment inquiry was gonna get roasted in a primary right which is  probably true Justin Amash would have gotten roasted at a primary the incentive structure has changed right 20 years ago 30 years ago there was an incentive to stand by somebody from the other parties say hey we've got this bipartisan legislation together even if it wasn't really bipartisan you wanted the appearance of it you would be rewarded for that today it would be a punishment and that has changed the incentive structure you cannot drift from your party without without commenting I don't think that's absolutely sure in the house I don't think we know yet how this is going to go down in the Senate we watched senator Toomey and I think there's still a  number of Republicans like him who may want more than just each side presenting its case we get some witnesses because - Danielle's point the reason why the public says wah wah wah is because they didn't see a real trial they saw grandstanding by you know partisans in the Senate there would be a real trial where they can't interrupt and they can't do but it's unlucky to see thatyeah but you did bring up a good point I thought it was interesting and I think it shows you there are vulnerable Republicans right who are uncomfortable with this - he's like don't get rid of this immediately right I'm not even sure I don't I'm not sure yet I want no witnesses like he he was not ready to say we know everything yet which is why McConnell's trying to strike an odd balance here I think yeah I don't you know i think what mcconnell said on fox news to hand it with to hannity was unconscionable in terms of just simply being the the leave the senate majority leader nobody was trying to send Hannity's audience a message I'm not calling hunter Biden right right would you know yes but I always I want to go back to the Democratic Party though in the sense that remember it took a minute for Nancy Pelosi to get here there there were folks within the Democratic Party who were not with the our greens who weren't with Maxine Waters who were actually making the case that we need more evidence impeachments not a good thing so I want to be very clear careful when we kind of make the equivalence and that I think within the Democratic Party there has been an ongoing debate between folks we used to call Blue Dog Democrats and progressive Democrats and so it's a bigger tent meeting of the people the  conservative Democrats that used to be a caucus in this now when you know where the moderate Republicans meet in the basement of the up there of the RNC in a small room I actually been there they couldn't get caught talking to me outside of the basement I guess people they do want to hear it but yeah I think I'm gonna end the topic here but to remind people after impeachment is all over we're still gonna get new information left Parnas is under investigation and I throw this out here he lied to federal prosecutors failed to disclose this million dollar transfer Russian bank account my point is after impeachment is over new information is going to come out that may help determine who quote-unquote wins this post impeachment political battle hello from Washington I'm Chuck Todd and thanks for checking out the Meet the Press channel on YouTube click on the
