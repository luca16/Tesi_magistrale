day 1063 of the Trump administration easily the most consequential day of this president's term in office tonight's vote in the full House of Representatives makes Donald Trump just the third American president to be impeached the very moment house members were casting their votes Trump was on stage rallying supporters in Battle Creek Michigan the New York Times and Washington Post front pages both put it succinctly with headlines that stretch across all columns reading simply Trump impeached tonight's vote article one abuse of power was 232 197 two Democrats as predicted voted with the other side moments later article 2 obstruction of Congress passed 229 to 198 three Democrats voted with the Republicans against the second article Tulsi Gabbard Democrat of Hawaii running for president as a Democrat voted present on both articles the lone independent in the house former Republican from Michigan Justin Amash joined Democrats voting for impeachment these two articles will now be sent to the Senate Trump is expected to face an impeachment trial there sometime in early January but as we said there's been a hitch in that just tonight we'll have more on that specifically coming up remember however it was a phone call between the u.s. and Ukrainian presidents almost five months ago now that put us where we are tonight almost three months ago speaker Pelosi made that decision to formally open an inquiry tonight indeed she delivered her caucus today clad in black she opened the more than eight hour debate on whether the president should be removed from office today a Speaker of the House I soundly and sadly opened the debate on the impeachment of the President of the United States if we do not act now we would be derelict in our duty it is tragic that the president's reckless actions make impeachment necessary he gave us no choice you've been wanting to do this ever since the gentleman was elected mr. Prez came forward and did what he thought fit for the American people but yet they wanted to impeach him on December 7th 1941 a horrific act happened in the United States and this one that President Roosevelt said this is a date that will live in infamy today December the 18th 2019 is another date that will live in infamy what we are doing here today is not only patriotic it is uniquely American America is a story of ordinary people confronting abuses of power with a steadfast pursuit of justice the impeachment serves two purposes number one stopped the investigation by the US Department of Justice and Ukraine into the corruption of Ukraine interference into the u.s. election in 2016 I am deeply concerned that any member of the House would spout Russian propaganda on the floor of the house I rise today in support of these articles of impeachment I come to this floor not as a Democrat not as a Republican but as an American who cares deeply about the Constitution the rule of law and the rights of the people never in all my years of serving in this great institution that I love and the people of my district did I ever expect to encounter such an obvious wrongdoing by a President of the United States so you heard how some of the talking points went today some of them translated from the original Russian we heard at least one Pearl Harbor reference one other moment that drew a lot of attention was when one of the Republican House members compared the impeachment of Trump to the trial of Jesus when Jesus was falsely accused of treason Pontius Pilate gave Jesus the opportunity to face his accusers during that sham trial Pontius Pilate afforded more rights to Jesus than the Democrats have afforded this president in this processthat brought this response from author and Jesuit priests father James Martin quote Pilate had Jesus beaten and whipped thrown into jail overnight marched through the streets carrying his cross then nailed to that cross until he died comparing the treatment received by the President to what Jesus suffered is absurd also only one of them is sinless president Trump spent much of his day inside the White House and certainly on his phone and today's proceedings were clearly on his mind just before midnight here last night he sent this quote they want to impeach me I'm not worried these people are crazy the president's social media feed erupted again early this morning with dozens of tweets and retweets including some in his favorite all caps quote I did nothing wrong and shouting now atrocious lies by the radical left do-nothing Democrats this is an assault on America and an assault on the Republican Party and we mentioned Trump was on stage tonight at his rally in Battle Creek Michigan as he was angry and raw and included a disgraceful retelling of the death of John Dingle John Diggle represented Michigan in the House of Representatives from 1955 to 2015 just under 60 years in all that's a record for Congress as any president would Trump approved military honors for Dingles funeral who as a world war ii veteran is buried at Arlington Trump talked about it in terms of a favor he did for Dingles Widow now congresswoman Debbie Dingell Democrat of Michigan Debbi need to answer a beauty so she calls me up my gate box ago her husband was here a long time but I need to give him the beach treatment I didn't give him the C or the D I could've nobody would have you know I gave the A+ to take down the flags why are you taking it down or ex-congressman they go oh okay do this do that do that Rotunda everything I gave you everything that's okay I don't want anything for it I don't need anything for anything she calls me up it's the nicest thing that's ever happened thank you so much Joey would be so thrilled he's looking down he said thank you so much I said that's okay don't worry about it baby's looking up later as for what comes next the Washington Post and political reports some Democrats including House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer are considering a proposal to delay sending articles of impeachment over to the other chamber and then into the Senate the post writes that they see a delay as a way to force Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to quote conduct a trial on more favorable terms for Democrats and if no agreement is reached some have argued the trial could be delayed indefinitely denying Trump and expected acquittal tonight the speaker was asked when she planned to send the articles to the Senate we would wait to send the articles until you understand what the Senate's going to do we'll make the decision as a group as we always have as we go along we'll decide of what that dynamic is but we hope that the resolution of all that process will be soon in the center [Music] I'm not good that would have been our intention but we'll see what what happens over there Senate MajorityLeader McConnell says he'll be meeting with Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to discuss the president's trial before the Senate leaves for the holiday recess andnot long ago McConnell posted that he'll be speaking on the Senate floor about what he called the quote House Democrats precedent breaking impeachment of the President of the United States meanwhile some new polls providing a late livewindow into the opinions on impeachment and this president new NBC news/wall Street Journal poll finds the nation split on impeachment and removal from office 48% say they support at 48 percent do not then there's a new survey from the Military Times they find Trump standing among
