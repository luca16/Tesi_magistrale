and on the 1060 third day of his presidency Donald Trump was impeached that now becomes the single most important fact about the Trump presidency he was impeached this is the single most important day in the Trump presidency but because we've seen it coming for a couple of months now because there was no surprise in the way this historic day unfolded today some people might not feel the enormity of this moment much of that is because the classic dramatic structure of Washington scandal investigations was violated in this story when The Smoking Gun appeared at the beginning of the story was almost 90 days ago when we first saw the White House written record of president Trump's phone call to the president of
Ukraine and we read Donald Trump asking for a favor though we read the words of that phone call identifying Joe Biden by name as the target of the investigation the President Trump was pressuring the president of Ukraine to announce Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced the beginning of an official impeachment inquiry and here we are 85 days later with the President of the United States mpeached it was virtually certain at the beginning of those 85 days that the  president would be impeached because the evidence of what became the abuse of power article of impeachment was right there in the phone call right there in the smoking gun in all previous political dramas of this sort the investigations began with suspicions then they the investigators slowly collected evidence and testimony and then toward the end of the investigation they found the smoking gun in Richard Nixon's case tapes of his White House conversations and that was the end of President Nixon in that classic unfolding of an impeachment investigation we don't know what was going to happen next we don't know what the evidence will lead to in that  classic version but this time we knew 85 days ago when Nancy Pelosi announced the beginning of the impeachment inquiry we had every reason to believe then would come to this because we had seen The Smoking Gun already we had read the words that the president spoke to the president of Ukraine and because we had the smoking gun some people who supported impeachment quickly shifted past impeachment in the House of Representatives to the problem of the impeachment trial in the United States Senate and instead of living in the suspense of the impeachment investigation those people went all the
way to the disappointment that the president would not be convicted and removed from office by the Republican Senate and that has left some people perhaps some of you less able to feel the enormity of what the House of Representatives has done in the last 85 days what Nancy Pelosi has led them to do for only the third time in history the House of Representatives impeached the President of the United States  tonight but none of this was going to happen if the people of the United States of America did not take the power into their own hands and elect a new House of Representatives last year a Democratic House of Representatives led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi the American people did that the American people put the speaker's gavel in Nancy Pelosi's hand the American people rushed to the polls in the last election and he gave Democratic congressional candidates 9 million more votes than Republicans tonight's lesson in your vote matters is that Donald Trump is now impeached because of that overwhelming vote for  Democrats to control the House of Representatives if Republicans had kept control of the house representatives in the last election then Michael Cohen never would have been called to testify to Congress and explain how Donald Trump directed him to commit federal crimes and paying off a porn star during the presidential campaign in what prosecutors called a conspiracy against the United States of America if Republicans had kept control of the house Robert Muller never would have been called to testify before the House of Representatives and most important if Republicans had kept control of the house we would not know anything about president Trump's phone call with the president of Ukraine Republicans could have and would have pulled off the greatest cover-up in the history of the presidency they would have covered it up now and they would have covered it up for history and the president of Ukraine would have would have given that interview on American television in which he would have announced an investigation of Joe Biden that President Trump was secretly demanding and we would have no idea why the president of Ukraine did that but now we do know we know it all because American voters rose up last year and said no to Republic control control of the House of Representatives the United States Senate is not a democratic institution it was not designed to be the United States Senate represents land not people and so in the United States Senate Republicans are over-represented compared to the number of Republican voters in this country the House of Representatives is called the people's house because it represents people not land the House of Representatives was designed to be more faithful to democracy than the United States Senate and so tonight what you saw in the House of Representatives was democracy in action what you saw was the power of your vote the vote that you cast last year in your congressional district for your member of the House of Representatives that was your vote in action tonight on the floor of the House of Representatives technically there  were 230 votes to impeach President Trump tonight in the House of Representatives but those 230 votes were empowered by your votes your votes made history tonight thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on the button below for more from the last word and the rest of MSNBC    Peter however folks may feel about impeachment the gravity of this moment is undeniable Lester that's exactly right good evening to you tonight we just saw what is a very bitterly divided America on display virtually every Democrat voting for impeachment every Republican voting against it tonight the historic moment in the house voting along party lines to impeach President Trump on this vote the yeas are 238 comes nearly three months after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry I soundly and sadly opened the debate on the impeachment of the President of the United States this morning delivering her final argument if we do not act now we would be derelict in our duty it is tragic that the resident's reckless actions make impeachment necessary he gave us no choice the house weighing a vote on the impeachment of a president for only the third time this is a political vendetta it has nothing to do with a crime committed there was no crime the danger persists the risk is eal our democracy is at peril House  Democrats charging the president with two articles of impeachment abuse of power that alleges presidentTrump's  solicited the interference of a foreigngovernment Ukraine in the 2020 us presidential election he solicited foreign interference before he is doing it now and he will do it again the president is the smoking gun and obstruction of Congress that accuses the president of defying subpoenas issued by the House of Representatives madam Speaker madam Speaker it's madam Speaker I rise in strong opposition one by one lawmakers explaining perhaps the most consequential decisions of their career we will hold this president accountable for corrupting our democracy we will impeach Donald John Trump we willclarify that in America no one is above the law I'll give you the bottom line Democrats are terrified the President  Trump is going to win reelection they can't beat him on the merits  the Democrats are caving to the far left radical base Republicans blasting it allas a partisan sham not one of the Democrat witnesses not one was able to establish that the president committed bribery treason or high crimes and misdemeanors right now the dark cloud isdescending upon this house I tell you what I do see I see coming off a president who will put his head down even through this sham impeachment and  he will do his job he will put the American people first tonight all eyes on the 31 Democrats from districts that voted for President Trump like Michigan congresswoman ELISA slot Caen who was both cheered and heckled back home after saying she would vote YES on impeachment are you gonna pay a political price for this for this vote I might I might and I went into that with eyes open right but I still really have immense faith in the Michigan voters I believe that they want representatives with integrity who will fight for them but tonight republicans argue this vote will help the president Democrats say Republicans are making a grave mistake are you well I can tellyou the only people in this chamber that are making a mistake there are my Democrat colleagues the polling suggested the American people suggested we're not the ones who made the mistake and we're not the ones who brought this upon the country Democrats emphasized the Donald Trump's name will forever carry an asterisk stamped in the history books beginning tonight whether Donald Trump leaves in one month one year or five years this impeachment is permanent it will follow him around for the rest of his life and history books will record it and Peter there was a dramatic moment when the impeachment vote tally was announced walk us through it yes sir that's right speaker Pelosi as you've seen has been focused and focused on keeping this a solemn occasion but at the very hint of cheers from some Democrats when the president was impeached you see there Pelosi gave a glare quickly silencing any celebration
