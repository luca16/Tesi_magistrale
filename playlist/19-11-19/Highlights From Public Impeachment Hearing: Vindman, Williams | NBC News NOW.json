    "DOCUMENT" : "on July 25th along with several of my colleagues I listen to a call between President Trump and president Solinsky the content of which has since been publicly reported prior to July 25th I had participated in roughly a dozen other presidential phone calls during my closed-door deposition members of the committee asked about my personal views and whether I had any concerns about the July 25th call as I testified then I found the July 25th phone call unusual because in contrast to other presidential calls I had observed it involved discussion of what appeared to be a domestic political matter I want to emphasize to the committee that when I report my concerns of July 10th relating to ambassador Solomon and then July 25th relating to the president I did so out of a sense of duty I privately reported my concerns in official channels to the proper authority in the chain of command my intent was to raise these concerns because they had significant national security implications for our country I never thought that we sit here testifying in front of this committee and the American public about my actions when I reported my concerns my only thought was to act properly and to carry out my duty about two weeks after that July 10th meeting President Trump and president Solinsky had their second call the now infamous July 25th call Colonel van Minh what was your real-time reaction to hearing that call chairman without hesitation I knew that I had to report this to the White House Council I had concerns and it was my duty to report my concerns to the proper proper people in the chin command and then what was your concern well chairman as I said in my statement it was inappropriate who was improper for the president to request him to demand an investigation into a political opponent upon especially at foreign power where there's at best dubious belief that this would be a completely impartial investigation and that this would have significant implications if it became public knowledge and it would be perceived as a partisan play who'd undermine our Ukraine policy and it would undermine our national security did vice president Pence provide a reason for the hold on security assistance to the Ukrainian president in that meeting vice president did not specifically discuss the reason behind the hold but he did reassure president zalenski of the strongest u.s. unwavering support for Ukraine and they talked about the need for European countries to to step up and provide more assistance to Ukraine as well as you know the intelligence community has 17 different agencies what agency was this individual from if I could interject here we don't want to use these proceedings it's our time I know the chair well we need to protect the whistleblower if please stop I want to make sure that there's no effort to out the whistleblower through the use of these proceedings if the witness has a good faith belief that this may reveal the identity of the whistleblower that is not the purpose that we are here for and I want to advise the witness accordingly now did you express any concerns to anyone in your office about what you heard on the call my supervisor was in listening on the call as well so because he had heard the same information I did not feel the need to have a further conversation with him about it your boss had concerns about your judgment your former boss dr. hill had concerns about your judgment your colleagues had concerns about your judgment and your colleagues felt that there were times when you leaked information and currently you never leaked information I never did never would that is that is preposterous that I would do that okay the day after you appeared for your deposition Lieutenant Colonel President Trump called you and never Trumper Colonel Inman would you call yourself a never Trumper representative I'd call myself never parties is it normal for the private citizen a non-us government official to get involved in foreign policy and foreign affairs like mr. Giuliani I don't know if I have the experience to say that but it certainly wasn't helpful and it didn't help advance u.s. national security interests you are aware that hunter Biden did sit on the board of Berea at this time I am well I know I know that my constituents in New York 21 have many concerns about the fact that hunter Biden the son of the vice president sat on the board of a corrupt company like Burr yzma the Obama administration State Department was also concerned and yet Adam Schiff refuses to allow this committee to call hunter Biden despite our requests every witness who has testified and has been asked this has answered yes do you agree that hunter Biden on the board of Burr yzma has the potential for the appearance of a conflict of interest certainly the potential yes president Trump stated on that July 25th call quote there's a lot of talk about Biden's son that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it it sounds horrible to me colonel Veneman when you hear those words do you hear the president requesting a thoughtful and well calibrated anti-corruption program consistent with US policy I do not two different people two impartial observers one felt the need to report the call because there was a demand that was improper and one that didn't report it to anyone you didn't report it to anyone right miss Williams I ensured that the information was available to my superiors so while all this might seem as clear as mud I think you're honest and candid assessments of what you heard on the call tells us what we need to know we have two independent folks non-partisans and I'm not hearing a consensus between the two of you about what exactly you both heard on the call that you heard at the exact same time if you can't reach an agreement with regard to what happened on the call how can any of us an impeachment inquiry is supposed to be clear it's supposed to be obvious it's supposed to be overwhelming and compelling and if two people on the call disagree honestly about whether or not there was a demand and whether or not anything should be reported on a call that is not a clear and compelling basis to undo 63 million votes and remove a president from office dad am I sitting here today in the US Capitol and talking to our elected officials as proof that you made the right decision 40 years ago to leave the Soviet Union and come here to the United States of America in search of a better life for our family do not worry I'll be fine for telling the truth you realize when you came forward out of sense of duty that you were putting yourself in direct opposition to the most powerful person in the world do you realize that sir I knew I was assuming a lot of risk and why do you have confidence that you can do that and tell your dad not to worry congressman because this is America this is the country I've served and defended that all my brothers have served and here right matters thank you sir\n",

Giuliani I don't know if I have the experience to say that but it certainly wasn't helpful and it didn't help advance u.s. national security interests you are aware that hunter Biden did sit on the board of Berea at this time I am well I know I know that my constituents in New York 21 have many concerns about the fact that hunter Biden the son of the vice president sat on the board of a corrupt company like Burr yzma the Obama administration State Department was also concerned and yet Adam Schiff refuses to allow this committee to call hunter Biden despite our requests every witness who has testified and has been asked this has answered yes do you agree that hunter Biden on the board of Burr yzma has the potential for the appearance of a conflict of interest certainly the potential yes president Trump stated on that July 25th call quote there's a lot of talk about Biden's son that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it it sounds horrible to me colonel Veneman when you hear those words do you hear the president requesting a thoughtful and well calibrated anti-corruption program consistent with US policy I do not two different people two impartial observers one felt the need to report the call because there was a demand that was improper and one that didn't report it to anyone you didn't report it to anyone right miss Williams I ensured that the information was available to my superiors so while all this might seem as clear as mud I think you're honest and candid assessments of what you heard on the call tells us what we need to know we have two independent folks non-partisans and I'm not hearing a consensus between the two of you about what exactly you both heard on the call that you heard at the exact same time if you can't reach an agreement with regard to what happened on the call how can any of us an impeachment inquiry is supposed to be clear it's supposed to be obvious it's supposed to be overwhelming and compelling and if two people on the call disagree honestly about whether or not there was a demand and whether or not anything should be reported on a call that is not a clear and compelling basis to undo 63 million votes and remove a president from office dad am I sitting here today in the US Capitol and talking to our elected officials as proof that you made the right decision 40 years ago to leave the Soviet Union and come here to the United States of America in search of a better life for our family do not worry I'll be fine for telling the truth you realize when you came forward out of sense of duty that you were putting yourself in direct opposition to the most powerful person in the world do you realize that sir I knew I was assuming a lot of risk and why do you have confidence that you can do that and tell your dad not to worry congressman because this is America this is the country I've served and defended that all my brothers have served and here right matters thank you sir",
