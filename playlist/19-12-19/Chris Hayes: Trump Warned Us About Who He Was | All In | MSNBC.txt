 good evening from New York I'm Chris Hayes president Donald Trump has yet another mark on him that he can never ever ever undo the House of Representatives decided to use one of the most extraordinary constitutional remedies at their disposal impeachment making President Donald J Trump just the third president in all of American history to wear that shameful mark the reason President Trump was impeached for article one abuse of power is because he tried very hard to extort a foreign nation into interfering in American elections he tried to get them to instigate a criminal investigation in in a country with notoriously corrupt prosecutors to go after an American citizen violating not just the sanctity of American elections for all of us the sanctity of protecting them from foreign interference but also the president's basic fundamental duty to stand up for the Americans he represents the second article Trump was impeached for his obstruction of Congress and that's because his posture towards the impeachment inquiry and congressional oversight in general is shown by far the most blanket defiance of any present in history as the Democrats laid out in the articles themselves president Trump quote without lawful cause or excuse directed executive branch agencies offices and officials not to comply with those subpoenas in the history of the Republic no president has ever ordered the complete defiance of an impeachment inquiry or sought to obstruct and impede so comprehensively the ability of the House of Representatives to investigate high crimes and misdemeanors there are still numerous people that Democrats in the Senate would like to hear from actually who've been blocked by the president people the president doesn't want you to hear from and we'll talk about whether they'll get to hear we'll get to hear from them in just a bit but normally the articles of impeachment would go to the Senate now in preparation for the president's actual trial the Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi you know in an interesting bit of strategic gamesmanship is not sending them over in fact she said last night she's waiting to see what the trial in the Senate looks like before handing over the reins now Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's Kylin said he doesn't care what morning or the other in fact he said frankly he'd like not to have a trial at all but it is clear not having the catharsis of an exoneration in the Senate is not going to sit well with the president here's what Senator Lindsey Graham said on Trump TV earlier tonight I just left president Trump he's mad as hell but they would do this to him and now deny him his day in court the reason they're denying his dating him his day in court sino their case sucks no president's mad so the president is clearly not in a good place he is well aware of what being impeached means for his legacy of course you want to get a sense of how Trump a person who's incapable speaking truthfully about his own interstates feels about this this is what he hypothesized President Obama would feel were he to be impeached back in 2014 do you think Obama seriously wants to be impeached and go through what what Bill Clinton did he would be a mess he would be thinking about nothing but it would be a horror show for him it would be an absolute embarrassment it would go down on his record permanently but this thing Oh he'd love to be a peach that would be so good it would go down as record permanently he would be embarrassed it would be a horror show for him Donald Trump said one big argument Republicans have made in defense of the president they made it for hours and hours yesterday and this is to the extent they've made an argument for you of course in good faith is that this impeachment was all essentially predetermined that the crime was pretextual the Democrats were always going to vote to impeach President Trump and I have to say as someone who has covered this story from the first day of this Congress night in and night out I've talked to dozens upon dozens of members of Congress I talked to their staff I can tell you the House leadership did not want to impeach the president they did not want to get at this point the Democrats have faced the question of what to do about the president's unconstitutional actions and tendencies since the day he took office and certainly since the day they won a house Majority and they did everything in their power all year to avoid it even though there have been voices pushing for a pitchman for nearly the moment the president took office because of his behavior House leadership led by Nancy Pelosi resisted those calls in the grassroots and for many of their voters and many in their caucus until they could resist no more until the facts came to light about the president misusing his office to extort a foreign nation into interfering in the next election we learned that from the notes of president Trump's phone call with ukrainian president when the ukrainian president said he wanted to buy more american weapons to defend against Russian aggression President Trump infamously responded quote I would like you to do us a favor though that was what changed things the facts changed things the president's actions changed things that's what brought us to this point the fights back despite the fact the president accepts no responsibility for it now the Republicans are right in a way that it was always kind of predetermined it was fated Trump would be peach but that is because of Trump's nature and his character all of this reminds me of a poem that Trump liked to quote on the campaign trail it's actually from a 60s song that then became a kind of viral meme that he then read and on the campaign trail was part of this really disgusting bigoted anti-immigrant tirade that he would do about a woman who takes in a snake as long as the snake promises not to bite her and then the woman takes in the snake and the snake bites her and the snake says to her you knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in confession of sorts I think Americans knew what Donald Trump was when a minority of us voted to take him in he warned us so now we are here hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're
