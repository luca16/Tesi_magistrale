 I want to I'll be brief this evening it's been a long day and I said most of what I wanted to say earlier in the day but I did want to end this evening and first of all thank you both for your testimony and your long service to the country we are grateful that you answered the lawful process of a congressional subpoena I wanted to share a few reflections on two words that have come up a lot in the course of these hearings and those words are corruption and anti-corruption we are supposed to believe I said I'm a genetic trait anti-corruption fighter that his only concern about Ukraine was that it would fight corruption but let's look at that argument let's look at the president's words and look let's look at his deeds ambassador Jovanovic was an anti-corruption champion no one has contradicted that that has come forward to testify here she was a champion and on the day she is at a meeting acknowledging in Ukraine another anti-corruption champion a woman who had acid thrown in her face and died a painful death after months she has called back to Washington because of a vicious smear campaign by the president's lawyer Rudy Giuliani among others she is recalled that is not anti-corruption that is corruption and one of the people responsible for this smear campaign in addition to mr. Giuliani and it is a long and sorted list of those who were involved is a man named Lutz n Co someone who the minorities own witness acknowledges has a poor reputation as self-serving and corrupt and what do we see about mr. loose Senko and his predecessor mr. shokhin what does the president have to say about one of these corrupt former prosecutors he praises them he says they were treated very unfairly that's not anti-corruption that's corruption and when ambassador Sandlin testified today that there was unquestionably a quid pro quo and everybody knew it conditioning a White House meeting that Ukraine desperately wanted to show its friend and foe alike it had the support of the President of the United States when that was conditioned that official act was conditioned on the receipt of things of value to the president political investigations that was not anti-corruption that was corruption and when ambassador Solomon testified today that he could put two and two together and so can we that there was also a quid pro quo on the military aid that that aid was not going to be released unless they did a public statement Ukraine did a public statement of these political investigations the president wanted that's not anti corruption that is corruption and let's look at the president's words on that phone call that infamous phone call on July 25th does he ask president Solinsky how's that reform coming in the Rada what are you doing to root out corruption what about that new anti-corruption court of course not of course not are we really to believe that was his priority no what does he ask I want you to do of his favor a favor investigate this crazy 2016 server conspiracy that the servers somewhere in Ukraine and more ominously investigate the Biden's that's not anti-corruption that is corruption and the next day when he's on the phone to master Sandlin in that outdoor plot restaurant in Kiev what does he want to know about does he want to know how Solinsky is gonna fight corruption of course not the only thing he brings up in that call is the investigation he wants into the Biden's that's not anti-corruption that is corruption every now and then there's a conversation that really says all you need to know and sometimes it doesn't seem all that significant but I'll tell you this one really struck me and it was a conversation that ambassador Volcker related in his testimony and was a conversation just this past September when he's talking to Andrei Yarmouk top advisor to president Solinsky and he's advising him as indeed he should you know you may not want to go through with an investigation or prosecution of former President poroshenko engaging in political investigations is really not a good idea and you know what your mocs says oh you mean like you want us to do of the Biden's and the Clintons well there's a word for that too and it's not corruption or anti corruption it's called hypocrisy and this is the problem here we do have an anti-corruption policy around the world and the great men and women in your department under secretary Hale and in your department miss Cooper they carry that message around the world that the United States is devoted to the rule of law but when they see a President of the United States who is not devoted to the rule of law who is not devoted to anti-corruption but instead demonstrates in word and deed corruption they are forced to ask themselves what does America stand for any more   want to introduce the members of our family all of them known to our veteran viewers joining us here at the table the politics editor for the route MSNBC political contributor Jason Johnson our legal analyst Maya Wiley who previously worked in the Civil Division of the US Attorney's Office in the aforementioned as in everyday Southern District of New York former US attorney and former senior FBI official Chuck Rosenberg also an MSNBC legal analyst and for good measure a former Democratic United States Senator from the great state of Missouri current MSNBC political analyst Claire McCaskill Claire might as well begin with you and come around the horn your reaction to what we've watched well we're hearing from the White House already that trying to hang their hat on that Sunland does not say he heard the president say all this that it was in fact Rudy Giuliani so you're gonna see now that this bus has run over a lot of people looks like to me that Giuliani is the next one up too but White House to try to distance the president from him but what's really clear in this testimony is that everyone knew that Giuliani had been tasked with accomplishing this dirty political up that Giuliani's job was to go over there and talk to a corrupt prosecutor and get this corrupt prosecutor to help them forward this theory that Joe Biden's character was less than stellar and you know it's obvious and now we have a witness who says yes Giuliani was speaking for the president yes Giuliani was insisting on this yes there was a quid pro quo so
