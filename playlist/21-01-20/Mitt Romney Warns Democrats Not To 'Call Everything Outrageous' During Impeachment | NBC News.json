    "DOCUMENT" : "if we can just want to get her reaction the Democrats say the Republicans are engaged in a cover-up right now your response to that well I think it's important to hear from John bulls and perhaps other witnesses obviously from both the defense as well as the prosecution the right time for that vote that decision is after the opening arguments that's the way the process was carried out during the Clinton impeachment I'm sure there'll be an effort to get a commitment on witnesses today but the time for that is not today the time for that is after the opening arguments when they talk about the timing the fact that this will be four 12-hour days with testimony that could go into the wee hours of the morning are you concerned about the Democrats the Democrats insist that this should happen in the light of day not overnight this key testimony I don't think it makes a difference what time of the day or we're listening to testimony it's going to be important testimony that we want to hear from but my guess is you guys are going to cover it regardless of the time of day that it's that it's on the air so let's not worry about that so much I yeah I think some advice I give our Democrat friends is that if you call everything outrageous then nothing becomes outrageous and the important matter I think relates to witnesses and the ultimate decision which will come after opening arguments Rabia Romney last one a lot of Republicans and a lot of Democrats appear to have made their mind up what do you say to those who already come into this with a conclusion in their heads I've taken an oath of office to apply impartial justice oday we will consider and pass an organizing resolution that will structure the first phase of the trial this initial step will offer an early signal to our country can the Senate still serve our founding purpose can we still put fairness even-handedness and historical precedent ahead of the partisan passions of the day today's vote will contain some answers the organizing resolution will put forward already has the support of a majority of the Senate that's because it sets up a structure that is fair even-handed and tracks closely with past precedents that were established unanimously after pretrial business the resolution establishes the four things that need to happen next first the Senate will hear an opening presentation from the house managers second we will hear from the President's Council third sinners will be able to seek further information by posing written questions to either side through the Chief Justice and fourth with all that information in hand the Senate will consider whether we feel any additional evidence or witness witnesses are necessary to evaluate whether the House case has cleared or failed to clear the high bar of overcoming the presumption of innocence and undoing a democratic election the Senate's fair process will draw a sharp contrast with the unfair and precedent breaking inquiry that was carried on by the House of Representatives the house broke with precedent by denying members of the Republican minority the same rights the Democrats had received when they were in the minority back in 1998 here in the Senate every single senator will have exactly the same rights and exactly the same ability to ask questions the house broke with fairness by cutting president Trump's council out of their inquiry to an unprecedented degree here in the Senate the president's lawyers will finally receive a level playing field with the House Democrats and will finally be able to present the president's case finally some fairness on every point our straightforward resolution will bring the clarity and fairness that everyone deserves the President of the United States the House of Representatives and the American people this is the fair roadmap for our trial we need it in place before we can move forward so the Senate should prepare to remain in session today until we complete this resolution and adopt it\n",
