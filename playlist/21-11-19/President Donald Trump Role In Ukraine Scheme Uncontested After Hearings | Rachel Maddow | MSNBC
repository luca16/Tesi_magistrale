 but beyond the involvement of those other senior officials I think it's worth noting here that where we did land on this fifth day of hearings was with the question being settled and basically uncontested now as to the president himself or during this scheme the president having full knowledge of this game and the president having direct personal contact with the people who were carrying the scheme out on his behalf him communicating with them about the scheme while they were doing it on his orders it is remarkable that this impeachment is sort of this young in terms of how far we've gotten through these proceedings and that part of it the president's the degree to which the president is personally and directly implicated it that's uncontested now the Republicans have even stopped fighting that that's just settled here for example is the second witness who testified alongside Fiona Hill today career foreign service officer David Holmes who was based at the US Embassy in Keefe now you said that at some point ambassador Sandlin pulled out his cell phone and called to President Trump this was an unsecured cell phone in that right yes sir in the middle of a restaurant in Keefe yes now you said that you were able to hear president Trump's voice through the receiver how were you able to hear if it was not on speakerphone it was several things it was quite loud when the president came on quite distinctive belief ambassador silent also said yesterday often speaks very loudly over the phone and I certainly experienced that he when the president came on he sort of winced and held the phone away from his ear like this and he did that for the first couple exchanges I don't know if he then turned the volume down if you got used to it if the president's moderated his volume I don't know but that's how I was able to hear it and so you were able to hear some of what President Trump said to ambassador Sunland what I hear the president say to ambassador Sandlin yeah he clarified whether he was in Ukraine or not I need said yes I'm here in Ukraine and the ambassador Allen said said he loves your ass what do you want he said he couldn't do the investigation so you heard president Trump asked ambassador Sandlin is he going to do the investigation yes sir what was ambassador sunland's response he said oh yeah he's gonna do it he'll do anything you asked and was that the end of the Ukraine portion of the conversation yes afterwards you described a follow-on conversation that you had with ambassador Sandlin where you asked him I think generally what did President Trump think of Ukraine's that is that right correct what did ambassador Sandlin say to you he doesn't really care about Ukraine did he use slightly more colorful language than that he did What did he say that he does care about he said he cares about big stuff did he explain what he meant by big stuff like I asked him well what kind of big stuff we have big stuff going on here like a war with Russia and he said no big stuff like to buy an investigation that mr. Giuliani is pushing now were you familiar with the Biden investigation that he referenced at that point yes sir and how do you have such a specific and clear recollection of this conversation with the president and your conversation with ambassador Sandlin yeah so this was a very distinctive experience in my I've never seen anything like this in my foreign service career someone at a lunch in a restaurant making a call on a cell phone to the president nine states being able to hear his voice it's very distinctive personality so we've all seen on television very colorful language was used they were directly addressing something that I had been wondering about working on for weeks and even months a topic that it led to the the recall of my former boss the former ambassador and so here was a person who said he had direct contact with the president and it said that over the course of time here he is actually having that contact with the president during the president's voice and them talking about this issue of the bight investigation that I'd been in hearing about so there we get the account right there's the president talking directly to his hand-picked man on the ground in this foreign country the president on that phone call checking in on whether he's getting these investigations he's demanding into his political rivals from that foreign country yes mr. president I'll give you whatever you want good good good getting my investigations right there's the president personally checking in on the scheme in the middle of it and there are witnesses to me and that part of it just isn't contested by the Republican side I mean the certain Pietschmann I don't know how much longer it's gonna go far again we'll try to chase that down some more over the course of this hour tonight but in terms of the president having done it ordered it personally checked in on it during its during the course of it being carried out Republicans just aren't fighting that they're willing to just let that ride and so you know we'll see about the others we'll see about vice president pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Energy Secretary Rick Perry and we'll see about what happens to all of the other very senior officials who have got their their arms or at least their shirttails you know stuck in the closing subway doors here themselves but as for the president's own role we've had five days of hearings and they've all nailed down different aspects of this that what he confessed to is what he actually did and the Republicans aren't fighting that at all once we've all agreed on that though what we get to learn next is even worse and that was made more sharply evident today than at any other day of this scandal yet that's
