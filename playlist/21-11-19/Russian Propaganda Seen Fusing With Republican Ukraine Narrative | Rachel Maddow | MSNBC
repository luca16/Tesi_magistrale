 we do not know if today was the last public impeachment hearing or not it's the last one that's on the public schedule for now if that means that this is going to be the final hearing well I think that means that we can expect the committee that conducted this hearing to start working on its report from the partisan divisions that seem evidence on the committee over the course of these hearings I think we would probably expect that both the committee itself the majority of the committee will produce its report and the Republicans will produce some sort of dissenting minority report with competing views regardless the majority report the actual report of the committee will then presumably go to the Judiciary Committee because in impeachments it's the Judiciary Committee that has to draw up formal articles of impeachment against the president the house will then consider those articles of impeachment whether or not the Judiciary Committee holds more hearings at that point in order to arrive at those final articles or to get ready for the vote we don't know the Judiciary Committee would produce articles of impeachment ultimately through whatever process the house would decide how they are going to vote on those articles of impeachment and then that goes on to the Senate so again we don't know exactly where we are in the process we're going to talk with a member of the Intelligence Committee today to try to figure out how much we can tell about how close they are to done and how they're going to decide we've got our eye on one important federal court ruling that's due on Monday that potentially could be influencing the committee's decision as to whether or not they think they're going to be able to get any more witnesses so they might want to hear from but while we're in this sort of limbo in terms of the process and how this is going to go forward because of the subject matter of this impeachment inquiry because of the the types of experts and career foreign service and career national security people who have who have done the real work in this part of the US government when when the president in the words of Fiona Hill today was having his own hand-picked people instead carry out a domestic political errand for the president which started to intrude on the real work of the government this domestic political errand in which he was trying to get Ukraine to help him out with his re-election effort because of all the people who were doing the real work of the US government when that domestic political errand intruded because those are the people who are the witnesses to what the president and his sort of henchmen here did what was sort of amazing for us the public today is that as they presumably closed out these public hearings today we have these two additional witnesses expert nonpartisan career foreign service and national security experts who closed out the witness testimony today the fact witness testimony today and for us the public those expert witnesses were able to give us a masterclass not only on what happened and what they saw but on what the impact of it was who the president hurt with these actions who his actions benefited also who came up with this scheme in the first place and whose interests does it serve whose interest does it serve that even as part of this impeachment process the Republican supporters of the president are still trying to push the scheme that he got caught trying to push in Ukraine based on questions and statements I've heard some of you on this committee appear to she services did not conduct a campaign against our country and that perhaps somehow for some reason Ukraine did this is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves the unfortunate truth is that Russia was the foreign power that systematically attacked our democratic institutions in 2016 this is the public conclusion of our intelligence agencies confirmed in bipartisan congressional reports it is beyond dispute even if some of the underlying details must remain classified the impacts of the successful 2016 Russian campaign remains evident today our nation is being torn apart truth is questioned our highly professional expert career foreign service is being undermined u.s. support for Ukraine which continues to face armed aggression aggression has been politicized the Russian government's goal is to weaken our country to diminish America's global role and to neutralize a perceived u.s. threat to Russian interests President Putin and the Russian security services aim to counter u.s. foreign policy objectives in Europe including in Ukraine where Moscow wishes to reassert political and economic dominance I say this not as an alarmist but as a realist and the cost of this investigation I would ask that you please not promote politically driven falsehoods that so clearly advance Russian interests and as I told the committee last month I refused to be part of an effort to legitimize an alternate narrative that the Ukrainian government is a u.s. adversary and the Ukraine not Russia attacked us in 2016 these fictions are harmful even if they're deployed for purely domestic political purposes but we must not let domestic politics stop us from defending ourselves against the foreign powers who truly wishes harm I will not be part of an effort to legitimize that alternative narrative narrative perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services that Ukraine not Russia attacked us in 2016 she says please do not promote politically driven falsehoods like that that so clearly advance Russian interests this alternative narrative perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services that Ukraine not rush attacked us in 2016 where did that theory come from that theory came from Russian and Russian security services who has propagated it well it started off with Russian security services but now it's kind of you guys right I mean that was that was powerful stuff from this career national security and intelligence official who up until about five minutes ago was the top Russia expert in the US government right powerful she's saying don't do this this whole Ukraine interfered in our election not Russia this is a false thing invented by Russia invented by Russian security services to help Russia and to hurt the United States and if you spread that falsehood if you promulgate that falsehood you are doing the Kremlin's work against the United States of America she literally says please she says please don't do this please stop promoting this false idea that has been propagated by the Russian government to serve the Russian the Russian government's purposes please she says do not do this it does not appear to sink in President Trump had good reason to be wary of Ukrainian election meddling against his campaign it's weird right I mean the Republican defenders of the President on the impeachment committee are very happy to continue promulgating this thing that the president was promoting in Ukraine nobody in the US government in national security intelligence believes that this is credible the president's own national security and foreign policy advisers told him this is not credible Russian security services are promoting it though for their own purposes so the president was promoting it and now his supporters in Congress are promoting it too they're just slogging away with this no matter the consequences this is an excerpt from a February 2nd 2017 news conference between with President Putin and prime minister or bond of Hungary where Putin says second as we all know during the presidential campaign in the United States the Ukrainian government adopted a you know dural position in favor of one candidate more than that certain oligarchs certainly with the approval of the political leadership funded this candidate or female candidate to be more precise mr. Holmes you spent three years as well in the US Embassy in Russia why would it be - Vladimir Putin's advantage to promote this theory of Ukraine interference first of all to deflect from the allegations of Russian interference second of all to drive a wedge between the United States and Ukraine which Russia wants to essentially get back into its sphere of influence thirdly to the Smerch ukraine and its political leadership to degrade and erode support for ukraine from other key partners in Europe and elsewhere the Russians have a particular vested interest in putting Ukraine and Ukrainians and Ukrainian leaders in a very bad light there is a great deal of hostility and ill and malign intent towards Ukraine and it suits the Russian government very much if we are also looking at Ukraine is somehow a perpetrator of malign acts against us there's also a benefit now isn't there for Russia to put the blame on Ukraine to cast doubt on whether they intervened at all in our election and blame it on a US ally as a way of driving a wedge between the u.s. Ukraine isn't that true well that's absolutely the case and in fact you just made the point about US allies the Russians like to put a lot of blame on US allies for incidents that they have perpetrated we saw that recently with the United Kingdom in the Russian Secret Service's attack on a former spy mr. scrip Island his daughter in Salisbury in England where you may recall that the Russians actually accused the British government of perpetrating this themselves so this falls into a long pattern of deflection and of the Russian government trying to pin the blame on someone else if you're on a hill today bringing up the attempted assassination of a former Russian spy Sergei script in the UK where sergey skripnikov there stalked by two russian military intelligence operatives they used a military-grade nerve agent to try to assassinate mr. scribble he and his daughter were very nearly killed by it also a random civilian who came across the nerve agent that they dumped in a public trashcan after they tried out this
