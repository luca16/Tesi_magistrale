 chairman Adler talked about treacherous at about 12:10 a.m. January 22nd the chairman of the Judiciary Committee at this party on the floor of this Senate said executive privilege and other nonsense now think about that for a moment executive privilege and other nonsense mr. Nadler it is not nonsense these are privileges recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States and to shred the Constitution on the floor of the Senate to serve what purpose the Senate is not on trial the Constitution doesn't allow which just took place look what we've dealt with for the last now 13 hours and we hopefully are closing the proceedings but not on a very high note only guilty people try to hide evidence so I guess when President Obama instructed his Attorney General to not give information he was guilty of a crime that's the way it works mr. Nadler is that the way you've United States Constitution because that's not the way it was written that is not the way it should interpreted and there's not the way the American people should have to live I'll tell you what's treacherous come to the floor of the Senate and say executive privilege and other nonsense we owed the rest of our time the managers have 27 minutes remaining mr. Chief Justice members of the Senate the President's Council has no standing to talk about lying he told his body today the president's told his body and told the American people repeatedly for example that the House of Representatives refused to allow the president due process I told you and it's available public document November 26 letter from me as chairman the Judiciary Committee to the president offering him due process offering witnesses offering cross-examination a few days later we received a letter from mr. sip alone from the White House stationery that said no we have no interest in appearing so in the one hand they're lying because the the the house is condemned by the president for not giving him a due process after they rejected the offer of due process that letter rejecting it was December 1st the president's counsel says that the house should have issued subpoenas we did issue subpoenas the president you may recall you should recall said he would oppose all subpoenas and he did so many of those subpoenas are still being fought in court subpoenas issued last April so that's also untrue and it's a heck of a nerve to criticize the house for not issuing subpoenas when the president said he wouldn't oppose all subpoenas and we've issued a lot of subpoenas and he opposes all of them and they're tied up in court the president claims and most members of this body know better executive privilege which is a limited privilege which exists but not as a shield not as a shield against wrongdoing as the Supreme Court specifically said in the Nixon case in 1973-74 the president claims absolute immunity Mississip alone wrote some of those letters saying that the president not only saying that the president but that nobody that he doesn't want should testify and then they have the nerve and that is a violation of the constitutional rights of the House of Representatives and the Senate and if the American people is represented through them it's an assertion of the kingly prerogative of anarchical print prerogative only the president only the president has rights and the people is represented in Congress cannot get information from the executive branch at all this body has committees it is a 200 year record of issuing subpoenas of having the administration of the day testify of sometimes having subpoena fights but no president has ever claimed the right to Stonewall Congress on everything period Congress has no right to get information the American people have no right to get information that in fact is article 2 of the impeachment that we have voted it is beyond belief that the president claims minar kacal powers I can do whatever I want under article 2 says he and then acts on that defies everything defies the law to withhold aid from Ukraine defies the law in a dozen different directions all the time and lies about it all the time and says the Mississip alone here to lie about it these facts are undeniable undeniable hey

digital exclusives thanks for watching   I just reset where we are for a moment because I do think this is actually a little surprising twist that we are seeing right here again what had happened right before we just had this surprise development is that the fourth democratic amendment had been voted down on a party-line vote we've seen append mints asking for subpoenas for White House documents State Department documents OMB documents this is a subpoena to Mick Mulvaney which was just voted down we had received word that the fifth democratic amendment was ready to go it was going to be a subpoena for Defense Department documents but Mitch McConnell stopped stepped in and interrupted the process essentially said I will I will slightly mischaracterize his remarks to make clear the way they landed which is to say that he basically said we're done with this this is how long is this going to go on how many of these amendments are there gonna be how later you're going to make us stay up let's stack these as clared described that meant they were going to get through them quickly some that are Schumer's response to this is interesting them we haven't yet talked about the implications of this he said no we're not going to stack these we are going to get a vote on every single one of these but he did say if you want to come back and do this tomorrow we can which would lengthen the overall process for how long the impeachment trial is going to go and it would seem that part of the Republican strategy here is to make it go as fast as possible I think fair that's exactly right and in Laura dove is her name I don't want to call her the woman in yellow again so let me give that in and Gary Myrick and they're technically called the secretary for the majority and the minority yeah that's Chuck is trying to make sure that the case he's trying to make not just just some Republicans that he might get to waiver on documents and witnesses but Casey's making to the American people that they have adequate time to present this compelling case about the need for witnesses and documents and he doesn't feel any need to short-circuit that and if Mitch doesn't want to continue to work tonight then they have the option of extending this process and allowing them to do the amendments it would have to be tomorrow afternoon because I believe the court has an argument the morning it does yes the Supreme Court has an argument in the morning so they wouldn't be able to start until 1:00 o'clock which means that cases wouldn't begin till probably the following day but you'd be extending that day to the tally you know what there was a race for there on a race to get this in for the State of the Union hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on
