 and senator I'm so curious to hear your thoughts as you watch your former colleagues what have you made of what we've seen transpires so far first I want to say Claire's doing a great job because we spent so many hours in that Senate chamber and we know how different this is but let me tell you having sat through the Clinton impeachment trial not a very happy time for me and for so many others there is no comparison here and the reason is that in those days we had trent lott and tom daschle the two antagonists in terms of party joined at the hip and working together the reason you were to seeing this unfolding like this so late at night and believe me people are exhausted even if they're not 80 if they're 68 or 7 they're tired is because the two leaders are not working together Mitch McConnell made changes to the resolution and according to what I can read between the lines from Chuck Schumer the Democratic leader that was done without even discussing anything with him and so what you're seeing is the you know both sides staring each other down and it's really really sad and it shouldn't be happening are you hearing from any of your former colleagues in the chamber number one and number two what is your level of confidence that Republicans on critical votes when we get there on witnesses like a john bolton will potentially cross over well you're seeing the so-called moderate republicans walking that party line right now and whether they have a chance later we'll see i am not encouraged today i felt better about it yesterday you would think after this incredible presentation by the managers and i have nothing against you know the lawyers for the president i know them but they just seem well just underprepared let's put it that way and they don't seem that interested and their facts are wrong and you see these charismatic house managers and I of course I give a shout out to Nancy Pelosi for selecting this group you see them making a meticulous case and one thing I will say I myself am amazed at how much evidence they already have but what they want to do is give more of an opportunity to the American people in the Senators to see even more evidence but they have laid out such a widespread plot really to undermine a a congressionally passed appropriation they had no right to do with the GAO called them out on it it's against the law and so many people were involved in this thing so this to me just watching this and I know most Americans probably didn't have the time or ability to do it is is stunning how deep this plot goes hey they're armed

lots of other great videos   the capital Jeff what do you have a brand well first I can tell you that this serves as a reminder that Senate time is very much unlike actual time we have exceeded the hard five minutes that Mitch McConnell said that this break would last but in that time you have White House legislative affairs director Eric uhland talking to us reporters still not ruling out the potential for the White House to bring forward this motion to dismiss they have until tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. Eastern that's the deadline and so they're holding that card in their back pocket he also says that the White House when they do present their opening arguments on the case that they will mount a robust and substantive debate the defense moving beyond sort of the the process arguments that we've heard and I suspect just in listening to him speak that we will see the White House president Trump's legal defense team do what House Republicans did during the house portion of this impeachment process and that is rather than look at all of the evidence and full and president Trump's alleged behavior what they will do is separate out all of the key instances and events and in certain cases assign motivations to President Trump that in many cases Balai the underlying evidence and so again that's why you often hear President Trump say the call itself was perfect devoid of all of the evidence that led up to the call and what came after it so so that is sort of the the messaging that we're getting from the White House team as this these proceedings stretch into what we're coming up against midnight here we have not yet even had a debate yet on the floor and the actual resolution and of course that has to happen first before they can move to opening arguments in this case right you are a jeff bennett reminds me of something we should probably say hourly we don't have we've never had the transcript of the call we've received a summary of the call which contains gaps and ellipses it is not a transcript from a recording of the call senator a question about a motion to dismiss obviously far different from an acquittal in the Senate but if you've got party line vote 5347 why not try it I think because Mitch McConnell knows he doesn't have the votes to pass it right now and I think that's what he's telling the president we can't do a motion to dismiss because we don't have 51 votes I think there are members who are uncomfortable short-circuiting this whole process and it would have the appearance of hey you know we're not gonna let them tell this story we're going to shut this puppy down and you know maybe that changes in the days to come but I as of today all of my friends on the hill tell me he did not have the votes to pass a motion to dismiss hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos  have effectively put forward is will there be a trial or will there merely be opening statements because if there are merely opening statements and then there is a motion basically to not have witnesses and their Senate Republicans Jam that down the rest of the body and then they have a motion to dismiss in effect the opening statements are actually the closing statements and so what we're seeing is the beginning of the end of a proceeding that does not look at all like the trial where you would have formal consideration of evidence and I think that question is very much open tonight I think the Republicans have been suffering from a circular logic they say the house process we refuse to participate but it's totally invalid because we didn't participate they say you have to take us to court - perfect subpoenas but once you get to court they say you have no right to be in court and of course they say you can't have witnesses unless they participate in the house proceeding but of course if they participate in the house proceeding there's no need for them to be witnesses here and so the logic is just goes around and around and I think they really fail to advance the president's case here tonight and Jeremy let's let's let's toss this question around we've been asking it on and off all day what's to stop John Bolton from sitting down tonight and giving a definitive Lev Parnas length to our sit-down television interview that would answer everybody's questions absolutely nothing he's free to do that he's expressed a willingness to do that to do that I think he really wants the subpoena because he wants to avoid some blowback from the president via Twitter and he wants to say mr. president you know I was compelled to do this and so if the Senate rises to that occasion and says the man has something to say he wants to testify and will issue a Mississippi 'no he's ready to go I actually think the other witness that really dominated some of the conversation tonight was Mick Mulvaney the house managers very effectively said if you want to understand the president's intent was it for his personal benefit or for the quote national benefit which is his central claim ask the guy who he talked about it with Mick Mulvaney said I talked to the president about it and of course we did it get over it why won't Mick Mulvaney come and be a witness in this proceeding Michael Schmidt the problem with Bolton the mechanics behind Bolton is that there is a interview of sorts a public thing coming about him
