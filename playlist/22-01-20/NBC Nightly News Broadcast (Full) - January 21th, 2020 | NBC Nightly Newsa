Nightly News with Lester Holt good evening the trial to decide whether an already impeach President Trump should be removed from office has begun in earnest it was a day of high drama and grave history in the US Senate 100 senators seated in silence the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court presiding as House impeachment managers and the president's legal tea instrument immediately squared off over the trials rules regarding witnesses and key documents Republicans calling them fair Democrats blasting the Republican drafted roadmap as a cover-up but managing to win an early concession from the Republican leader Peter Alexander starts our coverage tonight President Trump is officially on trial the Senate will convene as a court of impeachment both sides House Democrats who will prosecute and the president's defense team arriving in the capital a dramatic scene on the Senate floor all 100 senators the jurors warned not to speak here you hear you hear you all persons are commanded to keep silent on pain of imprisonment it follows a bitter clash over the rules the Senate's top Republican Mitch Cottle's say he was following the Bill Clinton impeachment model that allowed each side 24 hours to make its case the process was good enough for President Clinton and basic fairness dictates it ought to be good enough for this president as well but Democrats objecting to a key difference from the Clinton rules new limits that would force each side to make those arguments over just two days meaning sessions lasting late into the night why don't they want the case to be presented in broad daylight on something as important as impeachment the McConnell resolution is nothing short of a national disgrace then a surprise after at least one pivotal Republican raised concerns a pair of last minute handwritten changes allowing three days for opening statements and the documents from the house will be put into evidence that small group of Republican moderates could be critical on another flashpoint whether to call witnesses Democrats demanding a vote now including on former National Security Advisor John Bolden a trial without evidence is not a trial it's a cover-up but republicans argue House Democrats refuse to subpoena Bolden when they had a chance and that the vote on witnesses will come after opening arguments tonight another key Republican who Democrats were counting on is sticking with McConnell's plan the Democrats say the Republicans are engaged in a cover-up right now your response to that well I think it's important to hear from John Bolton and perhaps other witnesses obviously from both the defense as well as the prosecution the right time for that vote that decision is after the opening arguments later with the Chief Justice presiding both sides taking turns trying to persuade the jury house Democratic prosecutors insisting the rules are unfair I believe the most important decision in this case is the one you will make today will the president and the American people get a fair trial and saying it would have taken too long to go to court to compel witness testimony a president may not defeat impeachment or accountability by engaging in endless litigation we're acting as if the courts are an improper venue to determine constitutional issues of this magnitude that is why we have courts and for the first time the president's legal team which was not part of the house proceedings now making its case dismissing the Democrats case as partisan politics why are we here are we here because of a phone call where are we here before this great body because since the president was sworn into office there was a desire to see him removed inside the chamber it was unusual to see all 100 senators sitting at their desks silently as jurors many of them taking extensive notes I saw some notes being passed from one senator to another all of it before they're asked ultimately to render a verdict luster Peter Alexander starting us off and we want to bring in now Casey hunt Casey Mitch McConnell didn't really have the consensus on the rules today as it appeared he did what could that signal going forward in terms of the evidence and witnesses Lester that's right that's right those dramatic last-minute handwritten changes to the rules made just minutes before the trial opened came as a major surprise and it has my sources on both sides of the aisle bracing for bigger twists as this trial unfolds particularly on that key question of witnesses and there is real pressure on those Republican moderate senators to show the American public that they're holding a fair trial and that dynamic that we saw could mean it's more likely that people like John Bolton who could potentially have damaging new information on the president are actually called to testify laughter all right Casey thank you and as this drama unfolds and we noted the president is overseas at the world economic summit in Switzerland where he once again traded jabs with teen climate activists Greta tune Berg Kristen Welker is traveling with the president with back-to-back meetings in the mountains of Switzerland President Trump tried to show leadership on the world stage as the Senate impeachment trial got underway but he could not escape pressing questions about the turmoil back home including whether it was the right decision to leave the country on the first day of the trial for the Davos Economic Forum a glitzy gathering known for bringing together the world's business elite for his part the president tried to use the global summit to energize his supporters touting the economy key to his re-election the American Dream is back bigger better and stronger than ever before and he made new headlines reigniting an old feud with climate activists including 17 year-old Greta toon Berg who was in the audience when the president announced the US will join an initiative to plant 1 trillion trees saying this is not a time for pessimism this is a time for optimism in her own panel later in the day - Berg seemed to fire back saying it's not enough to plant trees and adding you say children shouldn't worry you say just leave this to us don't be so pessimistic and then nothing silence also making news here Ukraine's president Solinsky at the center of the impeachment controversy expected here in Davos tomorrow in an interview with The Wall Street Journal President Trump said he has no plans to meet with Solinsky but he's open to it Lester our Kristen Walker in Davos thank you and the president's team of course closely monitoring all this from Davos all the way back to the White House NBC's Hallie Jackson is there for us tonight Hallie what can we expect the rest of the week well listen Lester today was about the rules of the road but starting tomorrow the rubber really meets the road with House Democrats expected to make their opening arguments you heard a bit of a preview of that today if timing holds then Saturday it would be the defense teams turned multiple sources tell me those attorneys will take turns trying to dismantle what they have described as a politicized impeachment case now keep in mind there are three different audiences here in the room especially those key moderates the American public and the President himself who wants to see his lawyers get an acquittal and get it quickly Lester yeah Hallie let's talk about those senators four of them Democratic senators running for president or off the campaign trail as this goes on including Bernie Sanders who's facing a new attack from his 2016 primary opponent Hillary Clinton here's NBC's Jeff Bennett tonight Hillary Clinton unleashing on her one-time rival Bernie Sanders
