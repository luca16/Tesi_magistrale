explosive allegations Oprah Winfrey is speaking out for the first time on camera defending her controversial decision to abandon a documentary accusing hip-hop icon and businessman Russell Simmons of rape allegations he denies it's a move that has one of his accusers saying she feels sidelined by the superstar here's Kate snow the only question for me is what is the right thing to do Oprah Winfrey on CBS saying she knew her decision to pull out of a documentary about allegations against Russell Simmons would look bad I unequivocally say that I did not pull out because of Russell this is not a victory lap for him I cannot be silenced by a Russell Simmons Oprah says she believes the women featured in the film on the record I stand in support of these women but she also says she worried about inconsistencies in accusers stories and told the filmmakers Amy ziering and Kirby dick she wanted changes and didn't want to rush to premiere at the Sundance Film Festival I thought some things were
