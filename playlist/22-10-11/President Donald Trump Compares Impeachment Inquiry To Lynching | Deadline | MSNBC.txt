 I think that what we see here once again is this president attempting to change in the narrative using what I considered the real caustic terms in order to change the conversation tip him here the constitutional process too something like the mansion is far beneath the office of the president of United States when the going gets tough you can almost count down on your fingers the amount of time it'll take Donald Trump to turn to race-baiting to animate his core supporters some perhaps the clearest sign yet that impeachment and the swelling public support for his removal from office is bugging him Donald Trump today tweeted that his appeal impeachment amounted to a lynching we just showed you House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn calling him out for it but the condemnation wasn't limited to Democrats our friend michael steele from her head of the RNC out with a very graphic reminder of the real horror of lynching he tweeted this to Donald Trump and Senator Lindsey Graham who echoed and supported the president's comments today quote this is a lynching Trump this is not happening to you and it's pathetic that you act like you're such a victim but it did happen 247 black people in your state Lindsey a lynching in every sense you should know better Jayson and Frank are back with the table Jason I'll start with you I'm not surprised this is what the president does but I think in the grander scheme of things I'm old enough to remember when we had a Supreme Court justice who referred to him being asked questions Clarence Thomas says the high-tech lynching of an uppity black man it's always been fascinating to me that Republican parties and the far right in this country who were primarily responsible for massive domestic terrorism and lynching of black people in this country purely for the fact that we were trying to vote are always the first people to invoke that imagery when they are being held accountable for their behavior but I also want to add somebody besides Lindsey Graham to the list of people should be ashamed in themselves Jim Scott senator from South Carolina came for and said well you know maybe not lynching but it's it's it's a death row no this has nothing to do with death the only people who are dying are kids on the border encouraged right now because of this president this president is being held accountable by the Constitution that he refuses to follow for his own bad behavior and using this sort of red herring of racial animus in order to activate his side is not going to distract us from holding this president accountable it's disgusting and it's typical but we're not gonna fall for it in the media or the American citizens this time let me just put you on the spot Jason you think it's a mistake to cover it at all I don't think it's a mistake to cover it at all but I think it has to be covered in the context of what we did today I mean we started with William Taylor because I think what the president said was to distract us from talking about William Taylor he doesn't want us to talk about the impeachment so we can identify what he's attempting to do and counter it by making sure our coverage stays focused on what he's really responsible for okay and now that know that if you disagree next time you better give it to me at least Jordan we've come to expect this of Donald Trump as sad as it is but I was actually called to see Lindsey Graham you know co-signed the statement Lindsey Graham should be ashamed to have failed to who called the president out over something that is just completely reprehensible and I don't know how Lindsey Graham manages to look his african-american constituents in the eye the next time he's down in South Carolina yeah he probably just doesn't care because the way that he responded it shows that he really didn't think that it was that big of a deal when I hate to say it if you are not cognizant of that history look at what could happen again Frank reel click you've talked about the danger of Donald Trump's rhetoric to real danger in this country you know Nicole my first assignment in the FBI was to the state of Georgia I've worked Klan rallies cross burnings and violent beatings of blacks by corrupt police officers and I find myself at times trying to explain the president's behavior at any given time by either saying it's ignorance or it's deliberate strategy this is a deliberate strategy he knows exactly what a lynching is he's chosen to do this he's chosen to press the race button and appeal to his base that's what's happening here
