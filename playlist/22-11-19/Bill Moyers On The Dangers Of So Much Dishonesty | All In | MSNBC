 filled lawyers has been a journalist for more than 50 years he came to journalism after serving in multiple roles in president lyndon b johnson administration including press secretary he's been one of the foremost comic lers of the transformation of both our media in our politics he's covered three impeachments watergate through bill clinton to now Donald Trump about two weeks ago ahead of the Trump impeachment hearings lawyers and a colleague published a full-page ad New York Times calling on his longtime employer PBS to televise the impeachment hearings in primetime because they wanted working Americans to be able to witness in full the case against the present States joining me now the incomparable Bill Moyers thank you why why did you take that out out why do you think it's important for people to be able to actually watch the hearings themselves because they've only been with this one for impeachment hearings they are a powerful course in civic education if you watched every day this week as my wife and I did you really see how government works why we have embassies for example as you to say that's why we have embassies you look at those first-class civil servants foreign officers the Foreign Service officers and you see why we have in this you see how presidents can how this president has maligned those people if you just get what we get in the evening and the evening newscast and in five or six segments you can't see the organic process as it unfolds and to see that is to sit there and be both proud of the people who are telling the truth and deeply worried about the people who are lying you know it's funny you say that because I had that same thought watching a few of these individuals Fiona Hill lieutenant colonel VIN men George Kent in particular whose command just basic command and fluidity with the facts I mean there's one point where Kent's going back and forth he's saying well when did this investigation he goes well that began in 2014 and who is this person he was they just know they're briefed this is these are the people that we have inside our government and I thought for people that think these are bureaucrats the deep state or something this is a pretty remarkable thing to watch and for a president to propose a Trump to vigorously denigrate them to malign them with Judy Joo downy leading smear campaign against these fine public servants is disgusting it's repulsive it's abominable you've covered Watergate you covered Bill Clinton you're now watching this what is your general sense of what what the fundamental shifts in American politics and media are between the Watergate era through Clinton for now well the Watergate story started in the summer of 72 and ran until Nixon resigned in 74 it was a long-running story with one revelation after another there was a smoking gun that was the missing tape that Nixon first released the transcript of and then was forced required by the Supreme Court to release the whole tape and I wonder Chris I just wonder if there isn't a tape of this conversation between the president's Zaleski and and and and Trump that isn't back there somewhere in that in the in that in that closet it took longer to get at the story of Watergate there was a smoking gun as I said there are smoking bricks here carefully put into place by these who tested people who tested by these foreign service officers who testified this week one brick at a time so that you're beginning to see the pattern of what what he did whereas it it took some sudden releases it took some crises in the Watergate hearing for the truth to come out you know one thing that when I've gone back and doing a lot of reading about Watergate now partly in the sort of context of this and doing a lot of reading about Andrew Johnson's impeachment in the 1860s but in the Watergate context I think the way that you get taught the history is that it was foreordained he would fall that of course in a kind of almost Greek drama way fate would catch up to him but when you go back and you look at you think yourself you know if he hadn't taped himself there's a lot of ways it could have gone that Nixon just survived the whole thing I think he would have survived for one thing he never admitted his crimes Trump announced isn't called repeatedly no I'm too - yeah but there is there is there is another scent there is a similarity and it is this Republicans did not rush to get rid of Nixon it wasn't I think it was the few months before the actual trial that the first Republican representative said I'm convinced but Republican in the Congress did not want Nixon to go and in fact the Republican Party was polled just before the vote and 31% of them said yes he should go but two-thirds of them said no he shouldn't and that's basically where the Republican Party is today partisanship is a great insurance policy against impeachment if the Republican Party members don't fold don't see the light go over to the other side vote against Trump I doubt that there will be an impeachment we I think there's a there's an instinct I think always with Trump because he's so strange in many ways to kind of a historic eyes like never before and you know if you go back and you look at impeachment impeachment always pretty partisan actually history the Republic the big exception was Nixon actually when when you know when Goldwater goes and tells them you don't the votes um is it stronger now is the sort of you know politicians political scientists talk about polarization the intensity of that the media environment and the way that feeds can feed polarization do you see it as as way of course as I've seen extreme partisanship dominate politics in the last 20 years beginning with around Newt Gingrich who believed in in treating your adversary not as a foe but as an enemy to be just not to be defeated but to be destroyed and that fact that has been contagious and you you have it now you see it in the in the Trump testimony and in the Trump hearings if the Republicans hang tough as they did if they cling to their false defense of the president ignoring the evidence and live with their lives it's going to be a long drawn-out fight the other the other thing that's changed so much of course is the way the media works and the balkanization of it and I should say you know the people watching this right now we have people across the ideological spectrum to watch our show I know that because people come up to me and people I think assume like Oh yours preaching the choir but that said the media is quite balkanize right now and back during the Watergate hearings you've got three networks that basically 80% of American households are watching and that's just that now you have a million different ways in which information gets to people Facebook through proxy using which you can basically get a kind of predigested version that essentially assembles a fax or even in fact and fiction together to kind of ensure you never see the whole picture that is Trump's great strength he wants to own reality it means what psychiatrists call us ellipses they believe the only reality that exists is in their head and everything else they can dominate with their reality by creating a new reality so he is created in the reality of which his media share his his his philosophy which is we can tell you what reality is doesn't matter what you think it is whatever that says it is what the truth is we can create a reality that began in the Clinton administration when the first the first perambulations of the partisan right-wing media hated Bill Clinton and and and turn everything that was said done and presented as evidence against him and and and fortunately you know he was he was accused of perjury and accused of obstruction of justice and acquitted in the Senate of both of them although the thing that I always think about with Clinton and I've tried to say this to conservatives who I've had conversations with is that just because people are out to get you doesn't mean you didn't do the wrong thing and with Bill Clinton that was the case it was the case there was a plot to bring him down and he definitely shouldn't have done that and I'm curious whether we can get to that point here right I mean even we're just what we'll heard said the other day which is I don't think this is right but not impeachable it seems like the loyalty the president demands is so total that no one can even just say the obvious thing that this was wrong you shouldn't have done that no one has said that a few Romney around the edges but but did fail yeah exactly um do you have I get dispirited sometimes because I feel sometimes like not and my job is partly pulling on it to make it undo like I'm applying force in the wrong direction and I wonder how the knot gets undone particularly I watch this impeachment like do you what is your how confident are you that some of the worst pathologies that we have in our politics right now can be undone I think they are here until there is some kind of transformation in in in the American culture and an American body politic until enough people well I I would this listen to robert jay lifton one of the great forensic psychologists of our time wrote magnificent books about the survivors of hiroshima about Hitler's Nazis about people who experienced trauma yeah and he says there's only one way we're going to get out of this and that is to do what Bach clough Havel who had been the champion of freedom against the communists in Czechoslovakia and became the first president of Czechoslovakia said you have to live in the truth everyone else has to live in the truth and you have to attach yourself to organizations that are trying to serve the truth if we all if enough of us do that we might get Fiat Republic safe remember what Grover Cleveland said that the ship of democracy which is weathered many rough storms may like any great ship at sea sink from the mutiny of those on board throw them out and start putting the
