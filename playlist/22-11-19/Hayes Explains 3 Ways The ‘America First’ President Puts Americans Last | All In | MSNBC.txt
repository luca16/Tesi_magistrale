three marathon days of testimony in the impeachment of Donald J Trump this week we've now seen public testimony from 12 different witnesses including three that were requested by the Republicans on the committee though you'd never noticed by the way they treated them you know if you were pressed for time this week and I get it if you were it was a crazy week and you want a sort of top-line takeaway from all this testimony and all the hearings this week it's he did it that's basically the top line takeaway one thing that we have seen over the last two weeks is that there's been a lot of testimony about just how messed up it was for the president to do what he did to Ukraine right to withhold assistance and support from these young democracy I mean Ukraine continues to this very moment as I'm speaking to you right there literally in a hot shooting war with Russia right now thousands and thousands of Ukrainian soldiers have died Russia is currently occupying huge parts of that country and we are the u.s. we are Ukraine's ally and just to be clear here because I think there's got a little lost this week we are not Ukraine's ally or assisting them because of some deep state globalist agenda now we agreed to give them military aid because of wait for it a bipartisan vote in Congress 351 266 which by the way many of the Republican Congressmen you saw ranting all this week they all voted for Jim Jordan Devin Nunez among others they voted for the bill oh and then it was signed into law by President Donald Trump okay this was the policy the policy of both houses of Congress and the president the president signed for President Trump to then throw these roadblocks in front of the new Ukrainian president who's attempting to extricate himself from this horrible war of occupation at a time when they need our support it just it's an incredibly screwed up thing to do and we have a lot of evidence of that we got a lot of evidence this week but I want to be clear about something as we think about all the evidence we've seen which is that as messed up as it is this is not why President Trump is being impeached it is not what the president did into Ukraine that is impeachable it is what he did to all of us as American citizens and American voters remember this is the guy who goes around counting himself as America first he's looking out for Americans right but his conduct here is literally the opposite of that we've all seen in this testimony that President Trump what he's consistently doing is throwing Americans under the bus to a foreign interest selling America out to foreign interests first there's the fact the president is trying to and this is so central to this he's trying to get an American election determined by forces outside America by foreigners it is a grave violation of our sovereignty and democratic determination as a collective people we determine our elections we should let other countries determine theirs right we shouldn't we should we should not meddle in other elections and other people should not meddle in ours it's a universal principle we should apply though to our great shame as Americans I feel obliged to say we have violated that over and over let's be clear but we determine our fate and our future and we determine our elected representatives the last time 2016 Donald Trump solicited foreign assistance very openly he welcomed it and he weaponized it and he used it to win an election and it fundamentally did something deeply destructive to our sense of democratic legitimacy and as soon as he thought it got away literally the day after special counselor robert muller testified and a lot of people thought the whole thing was over who the day after he gets on the phone with ukrainian president and he tries to extort him me into meddling in the upcoming election so that is the first and the biggest infraction here to us as americans the second is that the president a states right now is providing active cover for the foreign entity that actually did sabotage our last election and not only that he's actually attempting to blame americans rather than russians for that sabotage and that shows up in on the part of the trumps phone call of ukrainian president that honestly people talk the least about because i honestly think this it is so cringe inducing lee nuts and it's the conspiracy theory that made its way into the president's brain and into that phone call of ukrainian president and it's almost too embarrassing to actually get into the details so republicans just have this euphemism for it they say 2016 have you heard that right in the hearings you wanted to investigate 2016 that's a shorthand trump didn't say 2016 on the phone call check the transcript he said CrowdStrike look at the call notes quote i would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with ukraine they say CrowdStrike i guess you have one of your wealthy people the server they say ukraine has it what is olanski thank you have that moment so four months after the call the president is still parroting that insane conspiracy theory literally this morning on Fox & Friends President Trump repeated the exact same thing almost verbatim a conspiracy theory which I'm going to explain in the moment is so nuts it's so out there that even one Steven James do see sitting on the curvy couch staring dead-eyed into the camera as the president ranted was forced to raise his voice with a gentle reminder that we live on planet Earth a lot of it had to do they say with Ukraine but mister doses are interesting it's very interesting they have the server right from the DNC Democratic National Committee who has the serval the FBI went and they told him get out of here you're not get it we're not giving it to you they gave the server to CrowdStrike or whatever it's called which is a country which is a company owned by a very wealthy ukrainian and i still want to see that server you know the FBI has never gotten that server that's a big part of this whole thing why did they give it to a ukrainian company where are you sure they did that are you sure they gave it to ukraine well that's what the word is and that's what is actually in my phone call of you know I mean I asked it very point-blank because we're looking for corruption are you did that mr. president you're sure about that again just bear with me here because all I have to explain what those words mean because almost no one takes the time to explain it do you feel like that because it's so wild like the CrowdStrike okay just to be clear CrowdStrike is not a Ukrainian company okay it's an American one and it's co-founded by a guy who was born in Russia who is an American citizen and it is a publicly listed cybersecurity company based in Silicon Valley in good old Sunnyvale California in fact get this they have a contract with the Republican Party right now they do digital security for fortune 500 companies all over the country and they happen to have a client back in 2016 the Democratic National Committee the DNC who got hacked in 2016 and they hired CrowdStrike to do the analysis what happened here and CrowdStrike were the first people to say we looked at it we analyzed it we found the culprit Russia hacked the DNC that is why CrowdStrike is the target because they were the ones who - quite a phrase blew the whistle on Russia they were the first ones to say this is Russia and so they have been a target of Russia and present Dom from ever since right fascinating how that works so the conspiracy theory that has been spun out of it ittan lives in the darkest corners the Internet and I mean like Chan's with numbers you'd never even encountered the idea of this conspiracy theory is that get this contrary to US intelligence and Special Counsel Muller Russia didn't actually hack the dnc no no no no instead the DNC hacked its own server then leaked their own emails which got their own head of the DNC fired okay and then in partnership with CrowdStrike they created a story framing the Russians for the hack they did it themselves and then they refused to let anyone investigate it and so they ship the physical server that had the evidence over to Ukraine just to be clear we have no reason to believe that there's like some server in a vault and key that is being locked away from the prying eyes the FBI but the whole CrowdStrike conspiracy theory it is I just you know I want to be real clear about this it's like 9/11 truther level nuts all right because what it says is that the attack that happened on America was actually done internally by Americans to themselves that's what he's saying when he says that and that is vile slander against Americans and it's vile slander off the purpose of getting cover to the actual foreign intelligence service that committed a grave crime against us the American electorate so that's two things third thing that is an American betrayal trail of Americans and has to do with President Trump what he's asking be done to the Biden's and I don't think this part of it honestly has gotten enough attention typically nations are jealous guards of their own sovereignty of their own legal process right I mean we want to deal with American citizens ideally in American jurisdiction we tend to be a bit suspicious of other countries judicial systems what's happening here is the opposite the president ID States is taking your private American citizen and trying to get a notably corrupt country Ukraine to attempt to subject him to their jurisdiction when he is not accused of any crime if hunter Biden broke the law that is a US Justice Department's business and that's our business and the American first guy right the guy who talks about standing up for Americans he's pushing a
