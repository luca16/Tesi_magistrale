 tonight House Democrats launching their case against President Trump arguing he abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden he directed the actions of his team he personally asked the foreign government to investigate his opponent these facts are not in dispute and that the president obstructed Congress by refusing to turn over evidence to House Democrats such a host sale obstruction of an crushin congressional impeachment has never before occurred in our democracy overnight tempers starting to flare this bitter back-and-forth between democratic prosecutor Jerry Nadler and White House Council Pat Cipollone II Nadler rebuking Republican senators you see a lot of senators voting for a cover-up voting to deny witnesses and absolutely indefensible vote obviously a treacherous vote he accused you of a cover-up he's been making false allegations against the president the only one who should be embarrassed mr. Nadler is you the Chief Justice silencing the room I think it is appropriate at this point for me to admonish both the house managers and the president's counsel in equal terms to remember that they are addressing the world's greatest deliberative body president Trump before departing at economic conference overseas defending sit Bologna Jerrold Nadler I've known him a long time he's a sleazebag everybody knows that Pat Salone is a high quality human being I've never seen that emotion and that's real emotion that's because he knows this is a hoax and I was very proud of the job he did and on the Democrats demand for new witnesses like former national security adviser John Bolton President Trump raising executive privilege the presidential right to confidential communications with advisers I would rather interview Bolton I would rather interview a lot of people the problem with John is that it's a national security problem he knows some of my thoughts he knows what I think about leader what happens if he reveals what I think about a certain leader and it's not very positive Democrats insisting they must be heard you will hear their testimony at the same time as the American people that is if you allow it if we have a fair trial they're on a crusade to destroy this man and they don't care what they destroy in the process of trying to destroy it Donald Trump the president's allies in his attorneys argue the charges are not impeach Abul offenses today President Trump appeared to waver on that with NBC's Kristen Welker depends but if you take a look at this and from what everybody tells me all I do is a modest late today Ukraine's president on the other end of that call in question with President Trump giving his assessment to NBC's Keir Simmons do you think President Trump should be impeached mr. president president Trump suggesting he'd like to face off with the Democrats in person the front row and stare their corrupt faces Democrats tonight focusing on those 100 jurors before them if this conduct is not impeachable then nothing is still denied House Democrats face an uphill battle trying to convince the Republican Senate that President Trump should be removed from office I was just in the chamber it's only the first day of opening arguments and already many Republican senators appear Restless several standing others regularly leaving the room   the truth is going to come out indeed the truth has already come out but more and more of it will more emails are going to come out more witnesses are going to come forward they're gonna have more relevant information to share and the only question is do you want to hear it now you want to know the full truth now you want to know just who was in the loop sounds like everyone was in the loop you want to know how broad this scheme was we have the evidence to prove the president Trump ordered the aid withheld he did so to course Ukraine to help his reelection campaign he withheld a White House meeting to coerce the same sham investigations we can and will prove president Trump guilty of this conduct and of obstructing the investigation into his misconduct but you and the American people should know who else was involved in this scheme you should want the whole truth to come out you should want to know about every player in this sorted business it isn't within your power to do so and I would urge you even if you are prepared to vote to convict and impeach and remove this president to find out the full truth about how far this corruption goes because I think the public has a right to know   Giuliani exerted significant influence in this process in fact when an August 4th uremic inquired again about the presidential meeting ambassador of Volk returned not to the National Security Council staff or to the State Department to arrange it and follow-up he turns to Giuliani again Volker told Yair Mach that he would speak with Giuliani later that day and would call the Ukrainian president's aide afterward volker then text Giuliani to ask about the Madrid meeting and to set up the call that he had mentioned the air mock Giuliani replies that the meeting with Yair Mach was excellent and that he would call later phone records obtained by the committee's show a 16 minute call on August 5th between ambassador Volker and Giuliani ambassador Volker then tech Cermak I and Ray had a good long talk with Rudi call anytime Kurt separately Volker told ambassador Sandlin Giuliani was happy with that meeting and it looks like things are turning around a reference to Volkers hope that satisfying Giuliani would break down president Trump's reservations concerning Ukraine but things had not turned around by the end of that first week of August by August 7th the aide was still on hold and there had been no movement on setting a date for the White House meeting ambassador of Volcker then reaches out to Giuliani to try to get things moving ambassador of Ole cortex Giuliani to recommend that he report to the boss meaning president Trump about his meeting with Yair Mach in Madrid specifically he wrote this is Volcker writing to Giuliani hi Rudy hope you made it back safely let's meet if you are coming to DC and would be good if you could convey results of your meeting in Madrid to the boss so we can get a firm date for the visit so this is a master of Volcker falling up Giuliani Giuliani's met with the top aide to the president of Ukraine in Madrid and he wants Giuliani to convey to the boss to Trump how good that meeting in Madrid was about the investigations so they can get the president of Ukraine in the door at the White House huh think about how unusual this is this is the president's personal lawyer who's on this personal mission on behalf of his client to get these investigations in Ukraine the president of Ukraine can't get in the door of the Oval Office and who are they going to or the going to the Security Council know or they going to the State Department no they tried all that they're going to the president's personal lawyer does that sound like a official policy to try to fight corruption why would you go outside of the normal channel to do that you wouldn't
