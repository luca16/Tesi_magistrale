 on that last matter that I was just summarizing in terms of that classified material let me just ask any of you listening that is that how you all understand it and members the way this came up over the course of today yes and did I think you described it exactly right there is something that Jennifer Williams submitted to supplement the record it's classified so we don't get to see it but the Chief Justice the presiding officer of the impeachment trial put it into the record for the senators mr. Schiff urged them to go look at it in terms of this document potentially being improperly classified which is something that has been raised in writing by Adam Schiff and raised on the floor of the Senate tonight by so Lofgren obviously it's the vice president's office that said it was classified they are being publicly criticized for that if it has been improperly classified and it should be something that the public can see who adjudicates that well it's complicated ultimately a court does if if it gets to that and I do think we may be headed for a train wreck on classification particularly if we get to the point where they subpoena documents and witnesses because they're gonna try or bowles testimony they're now making plans to try to say that everything he's going to testify to is classified and you can't classify things just to keep them out of the public eye there has to be a rational basis for the classification and ultimately it would be a matter for the judges and we already know they we know for a fact they use redactions in precisely this manner right I mean we have foil lawsuits that have resulted the production of documents even up till as Adam Schiff noted last night and then in the last tranche of FOIA documents we got someone got access to the unredacted copies of the emails and lo and behold there was no reason to redact the parts that were redacted saved to cover up things that look terrible and incriminating for the Trump administration we also know that they blew through a deadline to produce the 302 the interview with Jared Kushner which is now going to be taken up in court there's a purse of filing about that further review it further review it right so there's already I think it's already very hard to credit good faith with these assertions given the pattern that has already been established in the way they've gone about all Rachel that senators if they go to a classified briefing or they look at a classified document and they are confident that it is not it should not be classified they can speak out and tell people about it they could tell people they can't tell people about the content oh no but it's like in fact I think senator Murphy or one of the senators on the air in the last few days was talking about I asked him the question what if they try to phoney classify Bolton's testimony he goes well because I will make the decision to speak about it publicly so then applying the define exactly because then it flips then the people who've classified it have to show that they wrongly disclosed classified information and the predicate for that would be to prove that it should have been classified in the first place so that you're saying that if if what zoloft green and Adam Schiff are implying and suggesting about this classified Jennifer Williams document is true if it's an improper classification one of the 100 senators who was just given access to it tonight just moments ago by by John Roberts is order one of them might say this can't be classified I will risk this I'm gonna go and go for TV and tell you what's in the stock their staff will probably go crazy and go don't you dare this is way too risky but I'm willing to bet with the stakes involved here that if there's something important in that document and it's not what you'd make legitimate and classified somebody will in fact think about it can we just make what just on the flip side of this is Donald Trump constantly D classifies classified of actual national security information remember that he did it with a cup of Carter page in terms of his sisal warrants he also shared class of national security secrets with Vladimir Putin so when it's in his interest he absolutely shares national security the only thing we're seeing in the cover-up are the things that he feels are not helpful - what's your reaction to what senator McCaskill is suggesting terms how much of a high-wire would a senator be on if he or she chose to do what she's describing think quite risky I mean the classification system is designed for and sort of and the power of it is held by the president president delegates that throughout the executive branch so other officials can classify and declassify information but whole structure set up for a president not this president a president and so here's the danger a senator might look at it in good faith think this shouldn't be classified there's nothing about this thing that's important or secret or dangerous have disclosed and not understand how that information was collected and so it could be bad faith but it could be a perfectly good reason to keep it classified and that's why I think courts are reluctant to get involved in that dispute and that's why we often delegate that sort of decision-making to the executives one of the things that we're seeing I mean this is a microcosm of the issue writ large right which is a kind of constitutional crisis which is a variety of powers asserted by the executive that are checked by essentially good faith in Lorient loitering within the executive by an expectation of pursuing good faith whether in pursuance of an ideological agenda you do or do not like right what we are seeing and what we've seen from loitering in the in the administration in the courts and that has been there is resulted in these excoriating decisions from judges appointed by different parties right is this bad faith the constant bad faith in legal documents and in legal filings over and over and again essentially just lying to courts about the reason they are doing something and in all of these things whether its classification or assertions of executive privilege right these tend not to be refereed by the courts they tend not to get to that point precisely because they are worked out between the branches where there's some assumption of good faith on the law I think that's exactly right Chris first of all typically there's a accommodations process right when the executive wants to keep something from let's say the Senate or the Congress those two branches of government get together and figure out a way to get some amount of that information in some fashion the people who want it but there's another problem courts are loathe to interject into these political questions in fact there's something called the political question doctrine courts have typically said when it comes to this type of decision we are not really equipped to second-guess the executive on questions involving national security and so I think Claire is right the senator could disclose it but there is quite a risk there and I wouldn't advise it but ultimately if they do it then it does go to the court because the only risk to them is that they are charged with disclosing information and then it goes in front of a judge and a judge looks at it and goes well there's nothing here classified this is just Donald Trump trying to hide stuff if somebody is charged sure but I mean that's several the risk they would be faced the other any senator facing this sort of risk reward calculation would also have to think about what the public benefit is of disclosing this information to be good how much is in that Jennifer Williams one-page document about what pence did with Ukraine we don't know now and if it is about the way they're going to try to keep John Bolton's testimony from the public ever hearing about it that might be something depending on what he says that is that would lead them somebody calculating that risk versus reward right I told to land in a different way hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
