we have an all-star panel to walk us through some of the legalities of today's trial proceedings MSNBC legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Cynthiana Oxley attorney at NBC legal analyst Danny Cevallos he's here with me simply let me start with you house manager and chairman of the Intel committee Adam Schiff outlining the Democrats opening arguments I'd like to play something he said that pretty much sums up his case for Trump's removal from office Pietschmann exists for cases in which the conduct of the president rises beyond mere policies disputes to be decided otherwise and without urgency at the ballot box instead we are here today to consider a much more grave matter and that is an attempt to use the powers of the presidency to cheat in an election for precisely this reason the president's misconduct cannot be decided at the ballot box your reaction to that strategy I mean I think it's a good it's basically true that's that's the beauty of the strategy he was very effective today more effective than I thought when he was talking about the facts in the argument than when he was quoting Hamilton but I thought he was very effective at not only repeating and going through the facts but then taking a pause and and then asking the question why is that important and then answering it very effective today and if it is tone was good he was appealing to the better angels of the Senate and he was also taking the time in my opinion to appeal to the other jury in this case the the American voter and some have criticized I was getting too boring but the truth of the matter is different people tuned into television at different times and so we really need to make sure that not only are all the Senators are awake for this argument but everybody who Tunes in during the day in over the course of their day gets the information that they need in order to be really educated about what's happened in the White House Danny this morning in Davos the president talked about the document Senate Democrats have been trying to access here's what he said we're doing very well I got to watch enough I thought our team did a very good job but honestly we have all the material they don't have the material Danny the Democrats jumped on that one right away saying the president's bragging about obstructing justice there your defense attorney what do you say isn't it amazing that President Trump has successfully gotten us to a point where we automatically think when he says something like that oh he's not so great with words what he meant instead of material is substance he meant probably because I'm sure that's exactly what he's going to say let me say that this way he has to say that there's no other defense to saying we have the material they don't have the material because if he does mean documents and records that we were refusing to turn over that just bolsters the article to argument that he's obstructing Congress so that is not a good position but amazingly he will claim or his defenders will claim he meant we have the substance we have the more powerful argument and you know what we'll accept it well accept it because he's created an atmosphere where we think oh he doesn't really communicate well he does he's nuts doesn't have a very strong vocabulary he meant material or did he mean you know a better argument or a stronger argument or substance or facts and we'll buy it we'll buy it because that's what we've been conditioned to buy now Cynthia Whitehouse attorney Jay Sekulow told reporters today what he is most eager to rebut when it's the defense's turn here's a little bit of what he said notice what's not in the articles of impeachment allegations are accusations of quid pro quo that's because it didn't exist does quid pro quo the term quid pro quo need to be need to be specifically mentioned in the articles no it doesn't at all that was kind of a silly argument frankly in my opinion the abuse of power includes the the quid pro quo eating it includes a violation of the impoundment Act it includes essentially extortion and bribery it's it is an umbrella term to cover the president misusing his authority as the president for his own personal political gain and quid pro quo is part of that abuse of power Danny we saw the president talking just a moment ago he addressed the press several times today if you were his lawyer would you be okay with that well that's a soft ball of course not the first thing I tell my clients is do not make public statements but the other thing is a defense attorney is sometimes you have a client who's going to do exactly what they want to do after all wait a second you think this is one of those examples right and exactly that especially in criminal defense sometimes the client that does whatever they want to do that's why they're your client to begin with because they do everything their way their way or the highway and that's how they've arrived at this point similarly with Trump he's done everything even I'm called to mind of his dance when he was being inaugurated and he mouthed the words to Frank Sinatra's my way this is someone that does things his way when his attorneys meet with him he's telling them how it's gonna be and that's why he goes through a lot of attorneys because sooner or later the attorney has to do what's best for the client not exactly what the client wants so similarly I am certain every single lawyer he has had has tried to say to him dial down the social media and I'm sure every single lawyer has gone back to the other lawyers and said he's not doing it we have a decision to make can we continue to represent them or do we have to withdraw and in most cases you know they stay on board unless he materially
