 Democratic House prosecutors have now begun their opening arguments for removing President Donald Trump from office a new and substantive stage of the second day of the Senate impeachment trial if day one felt like an extended question can I get a witness day two has felt like the extended accusation one would expect in a criminal prosecution the managers presenting evidence that the president abused his office to stay in power that he did so knowingly and that he did so with a ton of help over a long period of time now that alleged abuse is clearly legally impeachable the managers explained citing everyone from Alexander Hamilton to Donald Trump's own attorney general who has recently written this was Wahl Trump was in office that a president is quote answerable for any abuses of discretion and is ultimately subject to the judgment of Congress through the impeachment process congressman Schiff brought those receipts to the Senate floor and argued they show something very bad for Trump that even his own attorney general could not defend his own president in this trial you will hear the president's lawyers make the astounding claim that you can't impeach a president for abusing the powers of his office couldn't go to Bill Bar for that opinion couldn't go to even Jonathan Turley their expert in the house for that opinion no they had to go outside of these experts outside of the constitutional law to a criminal defense lawyer and professor and why because they can't contest the facts Schiff they're starting with the law and moving to the facts and the prosecutors today used those facts that evidence to make the case Trump's abuse of power means he must be held accountable the president put his own interests above the national interest undermine the integrity of our free and fair elections threatened our national security he believes that he's above the law he can do anything he wants the president personally made this decision even after his own appointed advisors warned him that it wasn't in our country's interest to withhold the eight who benefited from this scheme an impeachable offense aimed at destroying the impeachment power itself as you will hear in the coming days President Trump has acted in a manner grossly incompatible with self governance what did the president know and when did he know it that concludes our introduction there you have it that's the emerging case against Trump presented on the Senate floor a case reverberating around the nation televised starting now for three straight days so a lot of people are hearing it we can measure that but there are other developments suggesting that some of the very jurors in the room may not be weighing all the evidence that's according to some spicy new remarks from a Republican senator if you poll the Senate son of Cruz nine out of ten will tell you they have not read the transcript of the House hearings and Mackenzie's wine table are the senators sleeping on some of the most important evidence of this era and also while we're asking questions are they literally sleeping there are no cameras pointing at the gallery where the Senators sit for the trial because the US Senate actually controls those but there are still journalists and sketch artists who can see everyone in the room one artist catching Republican senator Risch sneaking a few winks as the artist put is here the president's most valuable defender meanwhile weighing in off the Senate floor yesterday was about 11 hours of them telling us how bad their case was if I were the president I wouldn't cooperate with these guys at all shift Nadler and Pelosi impeach this president in 48 days I wouldn't give them the time of day I'm covering up nothing I'm exposing your hatred of this President to the point that you would destroy the institution cover-ups a big word and you can debate it but as for evidence even this president now admitting he didn't supply the material for this trial requested under constitutional law we're doing very well I got to watch enough I thought our team did a very good job but honestly we have all the material they don't have the material they don't have the material the president running away from cooperation required under law and flying away from Washington clearly he still has this Judgment Day on his mind he also rattled off the something of a detailed rebuttal to different requested witnesses I'd love to have Mick cope the problem with John is that it's a national security problem he knows some of my thoughts he knows what I think about leaders oh I'd love to have Mike Pompeo testify but it's a national security problem Rick Perry would love to testify but we're dealing with national security as Donald Trump argues that there is a reason security or otherwise that each and every famous requested person in his cabinet can't speak The Washington Post reported that some Senate Democrats might be exploring away whether to do a witness swap I could tell you though in our reporting we spoke with several senators on record now who dismissed that concept saying they won't trade relevant witnesses for irrelevant ones now as the prosecutors make their case in these next three days of the trial they have an open court there will be no rebuttals from the Trump side under these rules until Saturday and that makes it less likely that there will be the kind of live action spats that we saw in the late-night of this pre opening argument debate which had at a moment that I think many people will reflect on the Chief Justice of the United States of America reminding the people arguing but this is still a trial setting with rules for civil discussion they insist that the president has done nothing wrong and they lie and lie and lie and lie the only one who should be embarrassed mr. Nadler is you I think it is appropriate at this point for me to add Mon both the house managers and the President's Council in equal terms to remember that they are addressing the world's greatest deliberative body members avoid speaking in a manner and using language that is not conducive to civil discourse I do think those addressing the Senate should remember where they are remember where you are it's not every day or every year or even as a mathematical matter every decade they're gonna see the Chief Justice tell these people the president's lawyers and as he said the house managers to shape up now these arguments will continue Democrats at times striking a confident note about their evidence perhaps looking beyond just the hundred senators in that room consider house manager and one of Pelosi's deputies Brooklyn congressman Hakeem Jeffries taking an iconic line from a legendary Brooklyn rapper the notorious b.i.g as a direct answer to the lawyer for the president Donald Trump's lawyer Jack Jay Sekulow who had asked why are we here we are here sir to follow the facts apply to law be guided by the Constitution and present the truth to the American people that is why we are here mr. Sekulow and if you don't know now you know hey I'm all remember from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our YouTube channel below you could have been anywhere in the world that you're here with us and we appreciate that
