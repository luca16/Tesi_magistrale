 ladies thank you for joining us what do you think the managers have gotten across today the second day of opening arguments well again today I think they've done an excellent job of laying out the facts and connecting them obviously with the law but in particular of what I found interesting today was the emphasis on Giuliani and the fact that when we look at his active role in the subject of in particular the first article of impeachment the emphasis on the fact that he is the president's personal lawyer that he is not an agent of the government that he does not work for the State Department he is not a diplomat and just really pointing out how active he was and how explicit the president was and saying go talk to Giuliani which really emphasizes the point that this was about a political operative doing the work of the President as his personal lawyer and the work being for the benefit the political and personal benefit of the President as opposed to in the interest of national security or any other more and so when you put it like that given your knowledge both of these issues but also how campaigns work it seems that you're saying something straightforward that's important to the case the Democratic house managers are making which is this is more tied to the campaign than if it had been a a random staffer or press secretary the Giuliani is a super figure on the re-election well that's exactly right and and so and why I think the house managers are doing a good job is they are showing us as senators as the jurors but also the American people is showing the math showing the connection between these various you know seemingly perhaps unconnected facts but how they've been paint the full picture of the fact in particular again as it relates to article one of the impeachment that the president was abusing his power for personal benefit and in that way it was a violation of public trust and I think they've done a great job of also emphasizing then yesterday and today not only that that is the basis and there are facts that that that are I think overwhelming in terms of pointing out the basis of article one of the impeachment but then article two of the impeachment basically being the president's effort to cover up article one of the impeachment and and so I think they're doing a great job so far we don't know what the votes will be in the future on potential witnesses but we do know that after both sides present the opening arguments there is this a time for you and your colleagues to present questions and interestingly we already saw a little bit of a hint of where some of the potential key votes are I want to read to you when I'm sure you've heard about which is Senator Collins speaking out about something she wanted to ask about saying I was stunned by congressman nowthere's approach famously on the first night he made some comments that she viewed as impugning the Senators I wrote a note raising the issue of whether that itself was a violation of the rules the Senate the Chief Justice then admonished both sides I was glad that he did is this in your view a preview of where some of the questions may head and do you see it as an important line of questioning well all right let's just step back for a moment and all appreciate with the the fact that this is probably the most important responsibility that any member of the United States Senate has which is just just to sit as a juror in the in an impeachment of the President of the United States and for that reason then let's not be distracted by whatever is happening on the sidelines let's focus on the facts let's focus on the law and let's ensure that this will be a fair trial that it will be legitimate in terms of its process which is supposed to be about seeking truth and therefore justice and you know the tone of someone who is presenting the case really has very little to do with the responsibilities of each of us which is to pay attention to the facts to demand that we receive all facts and all evidence that is available including documents and that we deliberate then based on what the Constitution requires of each of us which is that we do fair and impartial justice senator Karl Harris thank you so much for sharing a little bit of your hey I'm already melbourne from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our youtube channel below you could have been anywhere in the world that you're here with us and we appreciate that   the Houston Petry managers have repeatedly referenced President Richard Nixon's impeachment process just this afternoon Jerry Nadler talked about Nixon smoking gun tapes then the smoking tape came out within a week almost everyone who supported the president a week before changed his position and the president was forced to resign because of what was revealed on the smoking gun tape within a week senator Goldwater and others from the Senate went to the President and said you won't have a single vote in the Senate you must resign or you will be removed from office because of the evidence of the smoking gun tape but what was on the smoking gun tape the smoking gun tape were recordings of President Nixon instructing White House officials to pressure the CIA and the FBI to end the Watergate investigation no law explicitly prohibited that conversation it was not in that sense a crime but President Nixon had abused his power he had tried to use to government agencies the FBI in the CIA for his personal benefit MSNBC contributor Jill wine banks worked as an assistant Watergate special prosecutor she joins me now and Jill what do you make of the idea that the president can be impeached even if he doesn't break any laws it's clearly the case that's what the Constitution says you do not need an underlying crime when the Constitution was adopted there was no statute no federal criminal code and yet there was an impeachment that said high crimes and misdemeanors abuse of power has always been the standard for what impeachment is it was one of the charges against Richard Nixon and I want to also stress that that smoking gun tape was achieved through a trial subpoena it was after the indictment by impeachment and so similarly here you can't argue that you shouldn't be able to have additional evidence that wasn't presented to the house before they voted to impeach which is the indictment it is possible that the trial gets more or evidence because more things come out or because you have more time to gather them so we should have witnesses we should have documents that are new that have never been presented to the house and you don't need a crime although in this case they're our crimes I would say that Trump has violated the impoundment Act he has violated the election laws by soliciting something of value from a foreign entity which is totally prohibited and he certainly knows it was prohibited because that's what was made clear in the Russia investigation Julie you cross-examine President Nixon's secretary we might not get any witnesses at all in these hearings we've talked so much about fair trial but do you think that will diminish the Senators understanding of the actual facts of this case I do there is a very strong and compelling case that the house managers laid out today they did an excellent job of pointing out why this matters why it violates the Constitution why it's an impeachable offense why it in dangers us but having the live witnesses does make a difference you cannot substitute anything for it I think that logically everyone who's listening now will understand that if you don't have all the evidence you can never exonerate someone because you didn't know everything so if you only present part of the case and you decide that you're going to vote not to convict it's not a valid decision because you didn't have all the facts so if the president wants to actually be exonerated then he must allow everybody to come in and on that subject let's just talk a little about executive privilege executive privilege is a valid thing to claim but it does not cover fraud and crime and so I don't care whether you're discussing national security whether you're discussing foreign policy if what you're doing as part of that is committing a crime if you're planning a corrupt scheme that is not covered that is exactly what the decision of the Supreme Court was in the case against Nixon they said he had to turn over the evidence against himself the tapes because the executive privilege did not apply when the conversation involves committing a crime so let's keep that in mind there is no legitimate claim and the claim being made so far has not even been executive privilege it's been I have total immunity I can do anything I want that is not true when Richard Nixon said to David Frost after he was out of office after he had resigned he said if the president doesn't it's not illegal that's the same thing that Trump is saying now and it's not true any more now than it was when Nixon said it Johanne Bank thank you so much for being with us
