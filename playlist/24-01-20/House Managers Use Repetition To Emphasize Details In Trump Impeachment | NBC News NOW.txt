 today the house managers hammered out their case for article 1 in the simplest terms possible here's our house manager Jerry Nadler presented it this morning in contemporary terms the framers had three specific offenses in mind abuse betrayal and corruption the framers believed that any one of these standing alone justified removal from office Susan Dell perceives here she's a Republican strategist and MSNBC political strategist Michael Starr Hopkins a Democratic strategist who worked on the Barack Obama Hillary Clinton and John Delaney presidential campaigns Susan first to you house manager now they're laying out his ABC's there what do you think of that strategy it was it's a smart strategy because as much as if we've been watching this too all day yeah Holly people are still tuning in throughout the day so that's why we have the refutation repetition and I think that he actually today really emphasized why you need to pay attention to the details to get that message across and perhaps he wasn't as aggressive as low as the last day or two which was probably to to the his credit you agree was a good that never toned it down a little bit and do you like the ABCs it was good and it was simple okay every criminal defense attorney will tell you simplicity is how you get it done keep it simple stupid yes applies in so many cases that's always one I think Republicans now are starting to get boxed in because the case is becoming overwhelming and so the question that's gonna be asked to them now is are you more afraid of Donald Trump or are you in support of our democracy and that's a question that's gonna be very difficult for them because the president is gonna hit them no matter what another tactic that house managers that uses this repetition right a lot of what we're hearing we have heard before I know the Republicans have criticized them for that but is that to the benefit of the people watching is that to the benefit of even some of the senators sitting there who may have been doing other things during the house inquiry absolutely because some people are watching on Twitter some people are watching on cable news some people are watching later after they get off work and so what they're doing is making sure that throughout the day they're hitting those same points over and over again so that people can be reminded and people who are new to this process can be updated for the first time Susan we know the president's team can't say anything until Saturday the president though has busied himself on Twitter over the last couple of days and every time there's a break his legal team takes an opportunity to talk to the press do you think those are wise moves or do you think that they should be using their time between now and Saturday differently oh they have to do that because of who their client is I mean that's really kind of straight to the point Donald Trump would be furious if his people weren't out there every at every opportunity this is very difficult for him to watch them seed the time to the Democrats for three days so that absolutely must happen but just follow up quickly on one point Mike made it's so important to recognize this ABC keep it simple and the effect it has on the Senators okay because it's an argument that makes sense it's very tangible where is every time to your question about when the president's managers go out there they're convoluting like everything and people don't really know what they're saying so that it doesn't sound that it may not be impeachable but Danny Cevallos said just a moment ago that he wasn't sure that what Jay Sekulow said that he had even said anything he said it felt a little circular there you go well and maybe that's what they're doing because they just have to try and keep Donald Trump just at bay and have him not go too far if they can it all avoid it Michael Senator Lindsey Graham said this today the press pan I'd like to play it he's saying somebody needs to be looking at the Biden's he told me that yesterday the President believes that what the by what happened in the Ukraine with the Biden's was inappropriate now whether or not that will withstand scrutiny I don't know the President believes that the Ukraine interfered in our election I can tell you without any doubt it was the Russians who hacked into the DNC it was not the Ukrainians all right I'd like to get both of your action I'm gonna start with you but this is something that has been proven false time and time and time again that the Ukraine did not interfere with our elections why does this talking point continue to come up why will it not die because it's convenient it's something that's played in conservative news and it gives people a confirmation bias but what I will say is Lindsey Graham had a devastatingly bad day today when Democrats continuously showed that video of Lindsey Graham and the Clinton impeachment trial over and over saying that you don't need an underlying crime it was devastating for him and it's why I think he left the room what do you think yeah everyone kept saying you wasn't there yeah Susan what do you make of that I mean is should the Republicans just drop this already well again you know we talked about the effective has on the president and who it's playing - this is playing - conservative media so these clips kind of go to Donald Trump's pace it's like when we talked about the impeachment hearings you know who got a better grade the Democrats are the Republicans they both did a good job playing to their audiences because that's those are the clips that are gonna run like I said on conservative media so that'll make the president happy and when the president's happy I guess Lindsey Graham's happy they're all good look I have to ask this though are the Democrats and I'd love for you both Joanna's but are the Democrats setting themselves up because for every soundbite that you can find if perhaps Lindsey Graham saying something different some of the Democrats felt very differently when Bill Clinton was being impeached and I imagine that the Republicans may try to use similar tactics to sort of say well wait a minute you know you you sung a different tune in the 90s well Matt Gaetz certainly hopes that Republicans will come out and he's more criticizes them last night but you know I think Democrats are doing something that's really smart they're taking the clips and using them against Republicans because we don't have witnesses yet and we don't know what we'll have witness all right and so allowing these video clips to come in is a way to get witnesses kind of through a backdoor testimony and it's been really smart I think really effective and I think it's why you see Republicans kind of disjointed on whether or not we're gonna have witnesses and kind of what we want to have next Ted Cruz says one thing now you're hearing Blackburn say another it's a mixed bag and I think that that shows that Republicans don't know what to do Susan question for you because I asked Danny this and as a lawyer he said you always want to go first as a defense attorney it's really tough to sit there and watch the prosecution put out this whole case and you just absolutely can't do anything but I have to wonder from a from a strategic point of view I mean couldn't the president's alerts couldn't they be sitting here and thinking or watching and saying okay well you did this and that didn't play well with the public or that didn't play well with the Senate and we're gonna change our strategy a little bit to do something more effective can they learn and benefit from from the prosecution well you've earned it you can always learn it and there's always certain things that they're going to be going to be able to do to pick apart something because no one gives a perfect delivery sure but for the most part the Democrats have so far been so disciplined on their message and here's the problem for the president's team are you doing a legal defense or a you doing the Trump defense because Trump says everything was perfect that's not necessarily the best legal defense yeah that's where the kind of conflict comes in
