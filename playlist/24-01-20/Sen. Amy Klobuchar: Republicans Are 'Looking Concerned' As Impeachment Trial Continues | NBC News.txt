senator whenever there is a stalemate in the Senate you're usually among the group of senators that tries to find a gang to break it up that's right I know that that is your thing well this is one of those moments and I know you have a personal relationship at times that's worked well with Lindsey Graham people like Lamar Alexander people like James Lankford tell me I know how you are I know you're having conversations of any of them turned into negotiations you know right now we're at this stage where people are just talking to them at least I am and saying come on don't you want to have some witnesses and that is what we're trying to get out right now witnesses documents something and I'm just hoping they remember that they don't serve at the power at the really at the pleasure of the president they are here for the respect for the people it's the people's and sent them to Washington DC you know how to read these guys you know how to read them on the other side are you getting a sense that there that there's some of these more independent minded senators that are ready to like oh can't we cut a deal I mean I know how they are you seeing that yet or no I I just see them looking guilty looking concerned about what's the evidence that's coming forward that the house managers the plea for our democracy this idea that hey come on at some point all this evidence is going to come up and you want to be part of this cover-up too this will be your legacy and that part of it is I think what really resonates why are they here why did they come here except to uphold our democracy so many of them are students of history themselves so that is what I think is actually the thing that might turn them to at least agree with us that we should have witnesses I don't know what we'll do in terms of their decision in the end but at the very least we should get all the testimony so they're not part of the cover-up with the Trump administration   in a last-ditch legal defense of their client the president's lawyers argue that impeachment and removal are subject to statutory crimes or to offenses against established law that the president cannot be impeached because he has not committed a crime this view is completely wrong it has no supporting constitutional text in structure original meaning congressional precedents common sense or the consensus of credible experts in other words it conflicts with every relevant consideration professor gerhard successfully succinctly captured the consensus view in his testimony professor gerhard does a high crime and misdemeanor require an actual statutory crime no there Mullane lee does not everything we know about the history of impeachment reinforces the conclusion that impeachable offenses do not have to be crimes and again not all crimes are impeachable offenses we look at again at the context and gravity of the misconduct this position was echoed by the Republicans expert witness professor Turley in his written testimony there he stated that it quote it is possible to establish a case for impeachment based on a non criminal allegation of abuse of power he also stated it is clear that high crimes and misdemeanors can encompass non criminal conduct more recently professor Turley again the Republican witness at our hearing wrote an opinion piece in The Washington Post entitled where the Trump defense goes too far in this piece he stated that the president's argument is as politically unwise it as it is constitutionally short-sighted he added if successful would also come at a considerable cost for the Constitution although I disagree with Professor Turley on many many issues here he is clearly right and I might say the same thing of then house manager Lindsey Graham who in President Clinton's trial flatly reject the notion that impeachable offenses are limited to violations of established law here is what he said what's a high crime how about if an important person hurt somebody at low means it's not very scholarly but I think it's a truth I think that's what they meant by high crimes doesn't even have to be a crime it's just when you start using your office and you're acting in a way that hurts people you've committed a higher crime there are many reasons why high crimes and misdemeanors are not and cannot be limited to violations of the Criminal Code we address them at Lenz in the briefs we have filed and the report of the House Judiciary Committee respecting these articles of impeachment   the president is on trial on the Senate but the Senate is on trial in the eyes of the American people will you vote to allow all of the relevant evidence to be presented here will you betray your pledge to be an impartial juror will you bring ambassador Bolton here will you permit us to present you with the entire record of the president's misconduct or will you instead choose to be complicit in the president's cover-up so far I'm sad to say I see a lot of senators voting for a cover-up voting to deny witnesses and absolutely indefensible vote obviously a treacherous vote a true of a vote against an honest consideration of the evidence of the against the president a vote against an honest trial a vote against the United States a real trial we know has witnesses we urge you to do the duty to do your duty commit a fair trial all the witnesses must be permitted that's Elementary in American justice either you want the truth or you and you must permit the witnesses or you want a shameful cover-up history will judge and so will the electorate
