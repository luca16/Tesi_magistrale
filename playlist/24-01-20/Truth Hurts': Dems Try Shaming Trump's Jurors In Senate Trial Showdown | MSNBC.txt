president Donald Trump's impeachment trial continuing as Democrats present their second day of arguments on abuse of presidential power the Democrats holding the floor and all the TV time leading to reports of huge frustration on Donald Trump's part the president breaking his all-time record for tweets in a single day a clear sign that his views are boiling over as you watch scenes like this Democrats hammering Trump's team for ignoring the substance of the allegations you will hear that this all comes down to a phone call that was perfect as if you had not just seen evidence of a month-long government-wide effort to extort a foreign government but you will not hear a refutation of the evidence you will not hear testimony to refute the testimony you have seen indeed if the President had any exculpate ory witnesses even a single one he would be demanding their appearance here and the house managers arguing with their exhibits just like you'd see in an actual trial and basically showing the jurors the exhibits are also doing the talking like charts are counting how every single move in the Ukraine thought was for Donald Trump's personal benefit an attempt to shred his claims that the concern was actually stopping domestic corruption in Ukraine president Trump has placed his own personal political interests first president Trump wanted to hurt Vice President Biden's candidacy and help himself politically he was doing it because it helped him for that he would sacrifice our ally and our own security and as millions of Americans are catching part of these arguments we know that from new data it is taking up dozens of hours across all the news channel and Democrats are using these three straight days to offer something of a pre bottle to some of the TV lawyers the president Trump will be sending over to the Senate floor next Alan Dershowitz in 1998 back then here is what he had and what he had to say about impeachment for abuse of power if you have somebody who completely corrupts the office of president you don't need a technical crime in attorney general bars view as expressed about 18 months ago the president is answerable for any abuses of discretion he can be impeached that's the safeguard and those are legal arguments about what the Constitution says is impeachable there is still the factual debate about what exactly Donald Trump did and how bad it was and does it meet the standard for the first time in history to the facts support forcibly removing the president now one of the best substantive arguments that Trump allies can make in this Senate trial is that even if this Ukraine plot was troubling even if it should be stopped by a co-equal branch of government an aborted attempt over a few months of clumsy foreign policy may not meet that very high bar for removal that would be a sensible argument to consider but let's be clear we can see it is not the main argument that we're hearing instead as these days have grinded on as the evidence has come out as the Senators have started talking openly about what they think of this evidence against the sitting president there are senators defending Trump leaning into something else something that conflicts with their actual job right there in black and white the constitutional responsibility to try all impeachments but now you have some Republican senators arguing that this whole thing has just become boring Lindsey Graham among them who has looked completely bored with these proceedings really from the word go just a few hours into their opening arguments they're already repeating the same points they made for 13 hours yesterday the restlessness and kind of the fidget enos is increasing as time goes on last night so it's Groundhog Day again today just repeating and repeating and repeating about every hour and a half they repeat themselves now when this trial first started we said something basic right here in our newsroom Americans just got their jury summons to observe this rare trial of the President and while some senators complain that a few days of the trial are repetitive they may think this is a relatable argument I mean who likes boring stuff but do they also risk looking out of touch because many Americans have hard repetitive jobs every day not just for a few days in this trial of one year a few days out of the year a few days out of there two years in the office most Americans respond when they're called to jury duty for trials that can run weeks and I don't have to tell you most of them have fewer fireworks than this thing and fewer Dershowitz is but maybe there's something else going on a Democratic senator leaving the Senate floor and suggesting the claims that Trump's allies are bored like much else in Washington can't be taken at face value senator Hirono arguing this as a cover for people who are yoked to Trump and they're actually worried that as this lid is peeled back too many Americans may see something that's far from boring an uncomfortable reality it is hard to listen to things that you don't want to hear truth and frankly I think what the Republicans are suffering from is the truth hurts the truth hurts was the senator quoting Liz Oh on purpose because that song broke out as an ant National Anthem as this scandal was escalating and hit number one on the Billboard chart in September 2019 the same very month a whistleblower exposed this plot that got Trump impeached either way though the lyrics apply to this false choice between boredom and accountability because think about how that applies in the Senate trial as lizzo says truth hurts needed something more exciting so beware those asking you to trade excitement for truth in the end it may not be a very good trade it is hard to listen to things that you don't want to hear true and frankly I think what the Republicans are suffering from is the truth hurts
