if you want to run for dog catcher you can't be that guy you can't be a guy who's so weak you leave your soldiers on the battlefield it's done the cancer of Donald Trump how everything he touches and I wish we could fest about five years and in addition to all the president's men here the Mulvaney's of the world the Michael Cowen's of the world who did not navigate as well on a certain jail a couple weeks ago that the Devon Nunez is of the world that everybody he will touch history will frown upon and I still the big mystery for me with all of these men women mostly men what what do they not get III don't understand the human behavior these soulless behavior the the WIMP behavior of just being so submissive I don't know what that what the spell Trump has over obviously we talk a lot about a cult leader but whether it is these buffoons we saw last week last two weeks on display or as we start to see behind the scenes or we we sort Giuliani morph from a respected politician to a buffoon to a joke what is it about this man it's got to be one of the great psychological studies of all time that forces men to find the lowest lowest core well I don't know how respected Julia he was it's what's interesting to me and I'll stay with this Giuliani piece for a second if you if you've worked near an executive government and governor mayor president there are always individuals who sort of extra governmental right there are always folks who exist sort of outside of the bureaucracy outside of governmental sort of responsibilities that do things on behalf of that executive but I have never seen to your point earlier someone who's effective so pervasive throughout government that they are engaging so many different facets to the point where you have a president saying he's gonna withhold congressionally approved funding to serve his own political needs if that were a Democrat if that were Barack Obama the impeachment wouldn't even have to go through a hearing he would have been pushed out of office a long time ago but the fact that we are here is what is so it's so disturbing I have people on the street voters who don't believe that Donald Trump will be convicted in the Senate but are now asking for Giuliani's arrest and imprisonment it's the question because you always ask the question because you've been around power closer than anybody at the highest level if you're gonna break it down and give it why why people follow this guy so blindly when it's so obvious to us in the movie theater watching the lemmings going off a cliff you work for president you've been around power your whole life yeah what's the difference I observe I mean Pompeo fascinates me because he's not without ambition he's not without a brain and he's not without some conservative instincts and he's willing to burn them all down he's willing to burn down the three pillars of his future conservatism he's willing to burn down strength because he looks like a wuss refusing to defend Murray Ivanovich and built all those guys and and to sort of submit to it he didn't just submit to Donald Trump he submitted to Rudy Giuliani and the fact and I go back to him again because Pompeii wasn't the first person to sort of have to look in the mirror and say how far will I go Dom McGann looked in the mirror and and the the line he wouldn't cross was firing Muller and if you read and I maybe have read it too many times but if you read that second volume of obstruction it's about the lines dawn began wouldn't cross and the notes Andy Donaldson took documenting it the fact that these guys didn't either read it and learn any of this unless the the line should be Mike the line that Michael cone should do I won't go to jail for Donald Trump because there are now what three guys go into jail Roger stone Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort the it's it's out there already he's been there long enough that if you do Donald Trump's bidding you will end up in jail and I just can't believe Mike Pompeo can't land himself on the right side of that line I think with every one of them and it's not just Pompeo it's it's Mike Pence as well it is power and corruption and ultimately the question is how much are you willing to corrupt yourself to have access to power and right now Donald Trump is powerful not just because of who he is but because of the basic commands inside the Republican Party he has been playing the music for the last three years that everyone in the Republican Party dances to and I think the gamble that all of these individuals are making Pompeo and Pence and everyone else in the administration is that the music isn't gonna stop or at least it's not gonna stop until they've managed to you know get their next office whether it's set it for Pompeii or presidency for either Pompeii or repents but the problem that all of them have with this scandal and with every other I keep thinking about the Watergate formulation what did you know where the president know when did the brand when did you know it it's different for these guys it's you know with Pompeo pets it's what did they know when did they know it and what did they do about it and with every one of them they knew everything well we keep finding us they knew everything they knew everything about this Ukraine scandal they knew it from the beginning and they did nothing and if they did anything at all it was to help the president execute this corrupt bargain not to stand up for it and stand up to it and the question with all of them is is the music ever gonna stop and are they gonna ever pay a price well I want to make the term with you to Phil Rutgers to the Washington Post great reporting because I saw your tweet on this last night I mean the back story and full rocker I want to pull you in on this too of the great Mulvaney scoop is this is an investigation into Moulton Haney's conduct by the guy who probably sits to his right or left at the White House senior staff meeting the White House canceled so this is against the backdrop of this White House investigating itself and throwing another guy I mean I guess he's already under the bus but maybe backing up over him yeah I'm a little curious that pets if alone is the White House Counsel it had his decision to open this investigation in the first place usually when you open an internal investigation like this at a corporation or inside the government it's because you want to go turn yourself in and turning the best set of facts to the authorities this way this is never going to do that it's not like they're gonna produce the results of this investigation to the house and say oh here's the you know here's what we did and we either made these mistakes or here's the evidence that's not incriminating I don't think they found any evidence it's not incriminating we haven't heard about we would have seen it it looks much it's been reported that the White House Counsel wants to be the White House chief of staff and here he you know so he starts this investigation that magically finds fault by the White House chief of staff and that leads to the dress it looks to me like the White House is you know continues to be a den of vipers where you have the White House Council leaking about the White House chief of staff and then you see this quote it's kind of snippy quote from OMB Mulvaney's people saying well it was approved by the lawyers at every step of the way a little bit of finger pointing back at the White House Council it's like a very nasty place to work well just to get in the weeds because our viewers fellow every twist and turn faux Rutger the White House Council is also investigating one of his deputies I mean mr. Eisenberg who's the White House Counsel lawyer assigned to this you know whatever you want to call it Pigpen of a mess is also being reviewed and it was his decision to store the notes from this call and a top-secret server that I think one of the witnesses mr. Morrison last week so it was a mistake that is also under scrutiny so what do you know about the White House counsel's investigation into his deputy and the acting chief of staff well some days Nicole around here it feels like everybody's investigating everybody else so I guess this is one of those days but the investigation into the deputy white House Counsel is significant because that that stems to the decision that was made to put the the notes the transcript of the call between President Trump and President szalinski into that secret server that's only supposed to be used ordinarily for more highly classified and sensitive conversations that was a decision that based on the reporting at least was made in the counsel's office and by that particular lawyer and and so that seems to be the investigation there that the broader investigation between our or into rather Mick Mulvaney's communications that we've been talking about this afternoon is clearly an effort by the White House to just get its hands around what exactly went on here and to really understand all of the facts that they're having to deal with us they deal with scrutiny from Congress into the into the quote unquote cover-up and I think Matt made an important point that shouldn't be overlooked which is that there's been tension here at the White House for months between the acting White House chief of staff Mulvaney and the White House Counsel Pat's abalone they have a rather fraught relationship that is not new but it has been exacerbated by the each Minh inquiry which was has just ratcheted up the pressure on both of these men and created a great deal of conflict between them and my last question that you know we're talking about Pompeo not defending any of his folks it's interesting that the first
