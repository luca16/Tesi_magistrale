 two of the central figures in the impeachment scandal the president's acting chief of staff and his secretary of state are under new scrutiny today acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney caught in some dicey email exchanges with OMB officials in which he appears to be trying to reverse engineer the legal justifications for a former NSC official fiona hill called donald trump's domestic political errand of conditioning military aid and a meeting on investigations into the Biden's in 2016 the Washington Post broke that story about the White House lawyers review of the events at the center of the impeachment inquiry and they reports quote the research includes early August email exchanges between acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and White House budget officials seeking to provide an explanation for withholding the funds after the president had already ordered a hold in mid-july on the nearly four hundred million dollars in security assistance and brand new emails thrust Secretary of State Mike Pompeo ever closer to Rudy Giuliani Giuliani is known to be under federal investigation by the Southern District of New York those new emails reveal conversations with Giuliani around the time the president's personal lawyer was angling for investigations into the Biden's and orchestrating that smear campaign against the US ambassador to Ukraine more Jovanovic from the New York Times quote the emails indicate that mr. Pompeo spoke at least twice by telephone with mr. Giuliani in March as mr. Giuliani was urging Ukraine to investigate mr. Trump's rivals and trying to oust a respected American ambassador to Ukraine Murray Ivanovich had been promoting anti-corruption efforts in the country mr. Pompeo ordered Ms ivanovitch's removal the next month one call between Giuliani and Pompeyo was arranged with guidance from mr. Trump's personal assistant the documents suggest and as we come on the air we're waiting for news in the case that could move former White House Counsel dawn McGann closer to cooperating with Congress and testifying about his time inside the Trump West Wing it's a case that could have ramifications for the impeachment inquiry the crush of babble Lissie for all the President's Men is where we start today with some of our favorite reporters and friends from the Washington Post White House bureau chief Phil Rucker NBC News correspondent Carolee with us at the table former chief spokesman for the Department of Justice Matt Miller Democratic strategist basil's Michael and our friend Donny Deutsch is back Phil Rucker take us through this blockbuster story that when it landed yesterday my phone exploded with alerts and texts and emails take us through what you guys broke yesterday about those email exchanges where it looks like McVeigh knees trying to conjure up some legal justification for putting a hold on funds that Congress had already authorized and the Pentagon and other agencies had already checked off from a policy perspective yeah that's right Nicole it's a great piece of reporting by some of my colleagues at the post over the weekend that looks at the efforts by the acting White House chief of staff Mulvaney to come up with a rationale and an explanation for why the president withheld the aid temporarily from Ukraine this effort was conducted after the aid was actually withheld so it was sort of a look back attempt to come up with a justification a rationale a number of emails between him or among him and other budget officials in the administration and including some inquiries as to whether withholding that aid was even legal this was all conducted by the way as part of a White House counsel's office review of that correspondence looking into this matter and it just shows the extent to which Mulvaney but others in the administration as well we're part of an effort to create a cover story for the president's decision to withhold that aid fill record there's so much in this story I want to read you one more chunk but I've got two more areas I want to explore with you and I want to get into this idea that the cover-up now appears to be inching as close as the crime in terms of the potential sort of blast radius for this White House and the people in it but let me read some more of this great reporting you guys report that also included in the review from the White House lawyers are email communications between OMB and State Department officials and others discussing why the White House was holding up nearly 400 million dollars in military aid and whether the hold might violate the law December 20 18 months before the Ukraine issues surfaced as a top priority for the president the Government Accountability Office had warned the OMB it was not following the law and how it chose to disperse and McCole congressionally approved funds I mean this seems like a much bigger swath of people that were concerned about criminality I mean I've just never seen concerns about breaking the law laid bare from so many different pieces this is the intersection of OMB and state the intersection of OMB and the Pentagon all these witnesses testified that they couldn't figure out why it was being held up it's being held up Fiona Hill told us why it was being held up for Donald Trump's domestic political errand yeah and let's just step back for a minute and and take in the big picture here which is that item to Ukraine which the United States has been providing for several years now is appropriated by Congress it's Congress's duty to determine how to spend taxpayer dollars in the budget process and so that that was the concern that administration officials here had about whether withholding it was a violation of law this aid is a standard part of American foreign policy that predates the Trump administration it's something the Obama administration was doing to help Ukraine defend itself from Russia which in recent years has become increasingly aggressive with its neighbor in Ukraine and and you're right about the breadth of the effort inside the administration it's not just the acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney but it was officials throughout the OMB which is the Budget Office of the administration as well as the State Department and elsewhere trying to figure out sort of what their story would be what the the rationale the explanation for withholding that aid might be and frankly trying to just determine what they were legally able to do given the guidance that they've been provided from elsewhere in the government Carolee it's not the only devastating piece of reporting over the weekend brand-new emails show that Mike Pompeo what's the expression being all mobbed up Mike Pompeo was routed up way back in March there the phone lines were burning and they were connected by no one other than Donald Trump's former personal assistant who put Rudy on the phone with Mike Pompeo who happened to sit in on that call where Donald Trump asked for a favor though what's the significance of Pompeo getting suck not just into the congressional impeachment inquiry but sucked closer to a man known to be under criminal investigation by the Southern District of New York yeah I mean a couple things Nicole one is you know Secretary Pompeo we've reported last week that there's tensions between him and president Trump for the first time really in their relationship over the impeachment inquiry and specifically the president's frustrated with him for hiring what he sees as deep Staters like Bill Taylor who was the than the top diplomat in Ukraine after murray ivanovitch was pulled back to the US so we now perhaps have a window into why Mike Pompeo has one of the reasons why Mike Pompeo has managed to stay in the president's good graces so so long because he was willing to do things that wasn't protesting you know the way say for instance you know john bolton was about what at Rudy Giuliani was doing so that's one thing and then another is that Mike Pompeo has political ambitions is open secret everybody knows that he doesn't he may run for Senate in Kansas he certainly sees himself as a potential presidential candidate and something like this too the more that comes out could really damage him politically so one of the things I think that we're looking for is kind of how he navigates this he's kind of an I'll own an island right now he doesn't have full backing be given the tensions that he has with the president there's not that relationship there in the same way it was a few months ago and he's really lost the building over at the State Department where he doesn't have the support of the people who work there and so how he moves forward as more and more continues to come out is going to be a very interesting thing to watch you know Donnie that's such an interesting point that Carolee makes I mean the question is never whether the men and women who go to work for Donald Trump will be employed in potential criminality and certain scandal it's how they navigate it and if Dom McGann is the model so he spent 30 hours with Robert Muller told him everything he wanted to know cooperated with that investigation became the star witness of the obstruction report but he somehow reluctant enough to cooperate with Congress he's able to sort of keep some of his membership cards of the GOP for whatever reason he'd want them Mike Pompeo seems to be failing all of the standards that Magan met he doesn't look like he's willing to cooperate with anything and he's failing the leadership test I mean I think the the Friedman op-ed last week calling him sort of a West Point graduate leaving soldiers his soldiers on the battlefield was devastating
