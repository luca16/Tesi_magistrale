 the impeachment inquiry into Donald J Trump barrels into its next phase with the first impeachment hearing in the House Judiciary Committee set just hours ago for next Wednesday morning that is the committee responsible for drafting the articles of impeachment based on that investigation conducted by the House Intel committee the Judiciary Committee sending a letter today to the president asked if he plans to show up next Wednesday and inviting him to question their witnesses from that letter to the president quote if you would like to participate in the hearing please provide the committee with notice as soon as possible but no later than December 1st the Judiciary Committee picking up the baton from the Intel committee for this next phase of the house impeachment inquiry as public support for Donald Trump's impeachment tops 50% and as a federal judge delivers a blow to Donald Trump's claim of absolute immunity for top White House officials writing in a ruling yesterday quote indeed absolute testimonial immunity for senior level White House aides appears to be a fiction presidents are not kings they do not have subjects bound by loyalty or blood whose destiny they are entitled to control now that case revolves around the congressional testimony of former White House Counsel Don began his lawyer on the receiving end of some flattering tweets from the President himself today that lawyer William Burke out with a statement of his own quote Don Magan will comply with judge Jackson's decision unless it is stayed pending appeal the Justice Department is already appealing the decision but it nevertheless guts the legal justification that's currently being deployed by the White House to justify stonewalling Congress if the judge in the case involving the testimony of John Bolton's deputy Charles Kupperman makes a judgement similar to the one we found out about last night it could open the floodgates for the testimony of senior impeachment witnesses like Kupperman John Bolton Mick Mulvaney and Mike Pompeo that is where we start today with some of our favorite reporters and friends with us from the New York Times Washington correspondent Mike Schmidt on Capitol Hill MSNBC's Garrett Haake former acting US Solicitor General Neil ha tiel's here and with us at the table former chief of staff for the CIA and the Department of Defense Jeremy bash and Korean John Pierce back she's chief public affairs officer for moveon.org Garrett Haake let me start with you these are two different cases two different judges but just talk about the potential impact of a ruling like the one in McGann's case on these so far seemingly reluctant impeachment witnesses the most senior administration officials sure as for McGann himself he's unlikely to show up and democratic investigators are at least divided on whether they want him at all remember he was called originally to testify about what he told Robert Muller something like seven months ago but what this could do is it could shake loose a host of other witnesses who Democrats do want to talk to not the least of which is john bolton and his deputy mr. Cooperman these are two folks who worked very closely with the President on national security issues they might argue for other exceptions as their lawyer have art has already done so saying that this ruling doesn't apply to them because they work so closely on national security issues but there are lots of other officials who Democrats would like to talk to folks who worked at the OMB for example the office of the Management and Budget political appointees who can help explain how money moved or how it didn't and why it didn't a number of other officials who all fell under the White House's argument of absolute immunity here essentially saying that no one as close to the White House could be compelled to testify at all this judge's ruling throws that out as a concept for White House needs White House advisors they could still but you know put forth different elements of privileged executive privilege and so forth on specific questions but the idea that they could be just blocked across the board from even showing up goes out with the bath water in this judge's ruling and if Democrats can shake loose some of those other witnesses really at any point up till they vote on the floor up till a Senate trial starts you know we know the broad facts of the case they're unlikely to change but any additional detail any more information could be the kind of thing that sways Republicans or more importantly the public in continuing to support this inquiry makes me let me read how your for covered this today in rejecting the Trump administration sweeping claim that top presidential advisors as mr. McGann was are absolutely immune from being compelled to talk about their official duties meaning they do not even have to show up the judge said the same is true even for those who worked on national security issues notably John Bolton mr. Trump's former national security adviser has let it be known that he has significant information about the Ukraine affair at the heart of the impeachment inquiry but is uncertain whether any congressional subpoena for his testimony would be constitutionally valid he wants a judge to decide Mike if it what is the potential impact of a similar ruling in the Kupperman case which is the one filed by a lawyer shared by mr. Bolten and mr. Bolton's deputy mr. Cooperman well that case has a whole other issue to it which is that the house has actually dropped the subpoena of Kupperman but government's lawyer Chuck Cooper wants the judge to rule on it anyway to get some clarity on this issue because he knows that it will hang around and he knows that Bolton's hanging out there look the house has decided not to subpoena Bolton I'm not sure exactly why they did that if they did do that it will continue to delay this and move it months and months ahead and it seems like they want to move quickly they obviously have scheduled things for the Judiciary Committee next week they want to move this to the Senate and the problem is is that that speed slows you know that speed moves them ahead quickly but it's it really hurts their ability to get those people the closest to the president and that sort of allows Republicans to make this argument that say look like you know we haven't heard from anyone you know who was in direct contact with the president besides Sandland and there's not enough evidence for us and they the Democrats are not able to pressure the Republicans enough no Katya might probably just describe what is going on behind closed doors among Democrats debating the pros and cons of subpoenaing that highest level of presidential advisors and we've seen some News reporting about john bolton going to donald trump John Bolton's lawyer made clear a couple Fridays ago that he had lots and lots and lots of interesting information about this affair his closest deputy Fiona Hill has testified to John Bolton's behind-the-scenes conduct in a way that you have to assume if John Bolton disagreed with her characterizations we would have heard from somebody can you just take the the latest reporting from the hill from Garrett and Mike and help us understand what the what the actual calculation must be for House Democrats yeah so first of all let's be clear about what's going on the president has gagged everyone in the executive branch from going and testifying on the hill every employee every document every email now a few witnesses have come forward and even Trump administration people and said I'm gonna go tell the truth to the American people and that's what we've been seeing these hearings in the last two weeks now the question is will former national security adviser Bolton and other people come and testify and a subpoena is like a document that forces these folks to come forward and testify and it can be challenged in court and what the Democrats are saying and I think there's a lot of force to this is look we already have the goods on the president you just read the transcript on July 25th you that outlines the entire case and certainly the witnesses over the last two weeks have demonstrated it so ambassador Bolton is just kind of gravy it'd be helpful to have but you don't need it and so I suspect what will happen in this dynamic is they won't subpoena Bolton because they know that'll take some time but as this moves to the Senate if they decide they want to call John Bolton as part of the Senate trial the Democrats in the house will be prosecuting the case will be absolutely within the rights to do so and it's almost criminal to think that this president is not allowing these people to testify who have first-hand knowledge I mean the American people should have that right now we shouldn't have to wait for the Senate but if we have to wait for the Senate we'll get it at the time of the Senate almost criminal Jeremy Bosch sounds like it might be another article of impeachment which was the case in the Nick and articles yeah and I love Neil's Thanksgiving metaphor by John Bolten being gravy actually it's gravy six months after Thanksgiving it's not necessary it's totally useless and you would never delay Thanksgiving to wait for the gravy six months later the Democrats has Neil pointed out as others have pointed out have precisely everything they need to move now not beat to beyond the fact stage to the lost age what is the law of impeachment what is the constitutional standard and that is what the House Judiciary will dive into to Mike's point about the Republicans trying to claim that there would be some process foul if the Democrats didn't wait for these witnesses I mean that's ridiculous they're the ones who are saying the witnesses cannot come how can they turn around and say we have to wait for the witnesses it doesn't make any sense so I think the Democrats have exactly what they need they'll move to the next phase and again I expect articles of
