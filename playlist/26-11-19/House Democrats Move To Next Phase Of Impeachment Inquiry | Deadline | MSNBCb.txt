impeachment to be on the floor before the end of the year well just to torture our Thanksgiving metaphor let me be the fly in the gravy bowl for a minute I mean I think the point is that the case has been made and you've got former Republican senator Gordon from organs saying the facts are the facts they're irrefutable and they're stubborn things but I think that what what Garrett and and Mike are also speaking to is the political reality which is that I have not talked to a single Democrat who thinks that conviction in the Senate is even possible I mean do some of these witnesses move the political equation well I but to Perry on that point I don't think that waiting for Bolton or Mulvaney or others is going to actually change that calculus I don't think that there's anything that those witnesses can say that will really fundamentally change where we are here which is that we've gone through several weeks of amassing the case from mostly career professional observers of the facts they presented their case the House Intelligence Committee is an enormous ly professional job and the facts are what they are and nothing that anybody says after this is really gonna change that so you offered to Perry I mean I'm gonna come back at you oh go ahead go ahead does that you Gary let me jump in here let me jump in here and torture this metaphor even further it is a perfectly acceptable turkey sandwich leftover days later look here's what we know about Bolton he talks he tweets he's writing a book he you know he cannot seem to resist wading into some of these issues if Bolton goes on a book tour in January during the impeachment trial his information is still useable it's still useful to the public it's still on there it's still the kind of thing that could move public opinion there are a whole bunch of other ways that somebody like John Bolton could affect this process other than being hauled in front of a committee to testify he has a penchant for wanting to tell his side of the story and if he does that at any point during this inquiry it's still useful Mike Schmitt it take us inside what the lawsuit is designed to do is it designed to give john bolton political cover to say hey I'm a good Republican I didn't want to be part of the Democrats political impeachment process but I you know sent my lieutenant fiona hill was up there colonel venom is that there I mean what what does he want to happen and if a judge clears the way for him to rule do you have the sense that he'd be relieved mad frustrated happy what's the sense from inside his legal team well I mean look it's still just on his deputy Kupperman but I think that there is a legitimate legal issue here where one branch of government is saying yes the other branch of government is saying no and this individual and comment has to make a decision and I think there's some concern and you know you know on his legal team truck ubers legal team that if they're you know if he's didn't if he was supposed to appear for a subpoena and he didn't appear and there was later a new administration Trump lost and let's say you know whoever became President a Democrat president that they may prosecute these folks for not complying with the congressional subpoenas so by going to court they're getting a judge to rule on this issue the couple minutes saying look the White House is saying you can't do this the hill is saying they want me to talk judge you decide because if there were to be a new president the statute of limitations is five years on knocking if you know for not complying with the Congressional Bena that would potentially protect Kupperman going forward well I agree with that Nicole but I also think you know that's only on why they wouldn't I mean I think the real question is why isn't ambassador Poland going and do and testifying like these other 12 witnesses have defying the president and so there was obviously some reluctance on his part to testify and indeed the decision yesterday by Judge Jackson gives him carte blanche if he wants to go and testify tomorrow he is absolutely within his rights under that order and you know it certainly gives them cover and I can't imagine anyone prosecuting him or anything like that you know given this order yesterday and so I think you know there's must be some reluctance on his part to go forward much and you know whether it's for the book or whatever who knows some loyalty to trump who knows Karine let's break this down the Democrats I I think there's some exasperation I sense from talking to people close to the committee that Bolton has a red carpet his story's been told by people like song line by Fiona Hill there is a model for someone like Bolton Tom McGann spent 30 hours talking to Robert Muller he never said in in terms of what we understand that he thought trunk committed a crime he was a fact witness and he managed to sort of come out of that as someone who nudged Trump to the just barely the legal side of obstruction of justice I mean there is a model for someone who wants to comply with an investigation but doesn't want to be viewed as throwing his boss under the bus first of all I don't eat turkey because I'm a vegetarian and you can keep the fly in the creek look I think judge Jackson's ruling yesterday put a was a total rebuke complete rebuke to the president being above the law the administration be acting like the president is above the law and and so that is a good decision that we saw said the thing absolute immunity is the thing it's not a thing and while it's great for you know this yeah now can began could do whatever he wants with it the target is Bolton I think the target like you said well he should come forward and speak his truth and tell us what's going on I mean like he has to make a decision now history is watching him where is he going to be on this is he really going to be about the book and the money that he's getting for the book and so I think we have to see what he's going to do I think there's still time let's see what happened what happened during the judiciary component which is probably gonna last a month and it's gonna go it's going to be passed on the floor and go to the to the Senate and then we'll see if it comes up in the Senate but now the pressure is on Bolton what is he going to do history is watching Garret let me come to you on some information that I think is ripening just as week came on the air I mean the the witnesses and the push for people like Bolden the people close to the president is one front but I understand the documents have also yielded some pretty fruitful morsels the kind of evidence that they've been able to go out and point to and talk to in terms of following the money and how the money held up talk about what we're learning about new documents from OMB yeah I've got some interesting new reporting on this first of all the actual impeachment committees have still are still getting stonewalled by every executive branch agency that they've reached out to but other committees in the house have been probing this from different angles and had a little bit more luck the House Budget Committee has managed to get their hands on some documents from inside OMB they've produced a summary of those documents that I and a few other reporters have taken a look at and what those show is that the very first time a piece of paper was signed as related to this hold on money for Ukraine was on the evening of July 25th just a few hours after President Trump got off the phone with President Solinsky in Ukraine that was the first official action taken to actually put this hold into place it was also the last time that a career official at OMB signed any document relating to that hold it was after that that those documents which had to be renewed and changed over a period of the next couple of months were signed over and over again by a political appointee at the budget office and I'll bring that back to my very first point that political appointee is someone who has thus far refused to comply with the subpoena and come testify but who could be affected by this order on them again case Neal Katyal I want to read you Donald Trump's tweet which we know from the Muller probe that his tweets were examined as potential witness tampering and efforts to sort of speak or channel messaging or threats or whatever to potential witnesses let me read you any tweet it to that this is from the president's Twitter feed I'm fighting for future presidents in the Office of the President other than that I'd actually like people to testify Dom McGann's respected lawyer has already stated that I did nothing wrong john bolton is a patriot and may know that i held back the money from ukraine because it is considered a corrupt country and i wanted to know why nearby european countries aren't putting up money also likewise I would love that Mike Pompeo Rick Perry McMullen II and many others testify about the phony impeachment hoax how might that age no catch y'all oh my god give me a break the idea that Donald Trump is out for like protecting the rights of future presidents I mean this is the guy who's going to destroy the notion of executive power people like us who served in the Justice Department really care about that and have husbanded that resource and he's prompting ruling after ruling to destroy executive branch powers like yesterday's opinion and so you know his legacy is not going to be to protect presidents but to weaken them and then the idea that he wants to let go and have these people testify that can happen tomorrow bring it on but this president isn't doing that he's gagged all those very people in that tweet Pompeo bolton etc from going and testifying and that's why the way you started this program was to talk about the House Judiciary Committee invitation next week for hearings and the very last line of that order of that letter that
