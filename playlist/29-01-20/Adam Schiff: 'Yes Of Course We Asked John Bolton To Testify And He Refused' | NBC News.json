    "DOCUMENT" : "on Monday President Trump tweeted the democrat-controlled house never even asked john bolton to testify end quote so that the record is accurate did house impeachment investigators ask mr. Bolten to testify senators the answer is yes of course we asked John Bolton to testify in the house and he refused we asked his deputy dr. Kupperman to testify and he refused fortunately we asked their deputy dr. Fiona Hill to testify and she did we asked her deputy the colonel women to testify and he did but we did seek the testimony of John Bolton as well as dr. Kupperman and they refused when we subpoenaed dr. Kupperman he sued us took us to court when we raised a subpoena with John Bolton's counsel the same counsel for dr. Koopman the answer was senator you serve us with a subpoena and we will sue you too we knew based on the McGann litigation it would take months if not years to force John Bolton to come and testify and I should point out because I think this is an essential point to underscore as the president's lawyers say they didn't try hard enough to get John Bolton or they should have subpoena John Bolton that's what they're telling you but let me show you what they're telling the court in the McGann litigation if we could pull up slide number 39 this is the president's lawyers in court in the McGann litigation in the court of appeals right now quote the committee meaning our committee lacks article 3 standing to sue to enforce a congressional subpoena demanding testimony from an individual on matters related to duties as an executive branch official I mean it takes your breath away the duplicity of that argument there before you saying they should have tried harder to get these witnesses they should subpoena they should have litigated for years and down the street in the federal courthouse they're arguing judge you need to throw them out they have no standing to sue to force a witness to testify are we really prepared to accept that now counsel says think about the precedent that we would be setting if you allow a house to impeach a president you permit them to call witnesses well I would submit think about the precedent you will be setting if you don't allow witnesses in a trial the simple answer is that a president can be impeached without a statutory crime being committed that was the position and the question was rejected in President Nixon's case and rejected again in President Clinton's case it should be rejected here in president Trump's case the great preponderance of legal authority confirms that impeachable offenses of legal authority confirms that it is not defined in criminal conduct this Authority includes nearly every legal scholar to have studied the issue multiple Supreme Court justices who addressed it in public remarks and prior impeachments in the house this conclusion follows that constitutionalist history text and structure and reflects the absurdities and practical difficulties that would result where the impeachment power confined to indictable crimes as slight thirty-five shows first the plain text of the Constitution does not require that an offense be a crime in order for it to be impeachable Alexander Hamilton explained that impeachable offenses high crimes and misdemeanors are different defined fundamentally by the abuse or violation of some public trust some public trust they are political as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself offenses against the Constitution are different than offenses against the Criminal Code some crimes like jaywalking are not impeachable and some forms of misconduct often offend the constant a fam the Constitution and the criminal law impeachment and criminality must therefore be assessed separately even though the president's commission of indictable crimes may further support a case of impeachment and removal\n",
