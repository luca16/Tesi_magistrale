 it is this a sign that you guys are conceding that you probably are not gonna find a fourth Republican you know check out yeah I listen to the questions every single one of them and try to understand whether there is another Republican colleague who is at least has an open mind on some of these issues it's hard to find but a couple of times I thought they were close but still the three prime suspects remain the same in the course of this do you it look yesterday the Q&A; portion felt as if and and both parties were doing this they were more interested in giving the the counsels that they're believing more time to rebut there wasn't a lot of attempts whether it was by the Democrats to challenge some of the legal arguments on the Republican side or vice versa does that change today I don't know that it changes much this is an awkward situation you know we spend our lives as senator standing up speaking using our skills if we have them in this case we are putting in writing in a very brief question we've been warned by the Chief Justice don't get carried away a very brief question in the hopes that it will be answered and we know everyone knows that it's easy to evade a question in in this case it is hard you're one step removed from making an important political point and you've got to hope that the person you're sending the question to will pick up on it and handle it effectively well I only ask this because it did seem one of the one of the tougher questions that the Republicans had to deal with came from senators Collins in Murkowski was on the issue of the president's inch you know I did he show any interest in the Biden's before essentially a spring of 19 I didn't sense any many follow-ups in the Democratic side to the Republican side on that question but let me get back to the earlier observation that you made the fact that it came from collins of Murkowski meant that the president's counsel couldn't just brush it off they really had to address it for fear that they would make the situation worse when it comes to defectors of potential defectors from the McConnell so there was a dynamic dynamic involved there republican or republican which would not have applied if they'd sent the same question over to the house managers   Democratic senator from New Jersey Cory Booker joins us now senator these words jumped out at me just there I don't know if you could hear congressman Schiff he called it the normalization of lawlessness if you look at John Kelly former White House chief of staff saying if it's between John Bolton's word and Donald Trump's I believe John Bolton I spoke to two former senior national security officials from inside the Trump administration who today said they would very much like to hear what John Bolton has to say how is it that it would appear right now that the vote count comes up one short of even hearing from a first-hand witness like John Bolton I'm worried that we as a nation are getting outrage fatigue yeah just think about this the president's own chief of staff saying I trust John Bolton not the President illicitly really just outing what we all know that this president has lied repeatedly over and over again and John Bolton I disagree with him wildly on a lot of things but he has a reputation in Washington for being such a straight shooter and so now we have this this awful awful daunting moment in American history where there is truth out there that is easily accessible to the president's misconduct and not just any misconduct this isn't something on sort of his domestic life or or even a internal politics in our country this is goes to the heart of what national security is about and fundamental ideals that our founders talk to like not having foreign interference in our elections this is a watershed moment and the complicity of all those who say that this is not relevant that John that getting to the truth is not necessary and for them to manufacture legal arguments to manufacture arguments that basically say this kind of corruption would have been acceptable to the founders and is not violation not a violation of his constitutional duty and oh that's ridiculous do not lose your outrage in this moment and we may lose ultimately this impeachment but please channel that outrage into the coming elections because clearly that will be the ultimate moment of accountability for this president's corruption I mean senator I guess what I hear from you is you two are conceding what just is is undeniable in its on atom shifts face its in Casey hunts reporting from Capitol Hill that this battle feels to you and please jump in and correct me if I'm wrong lost that it's your belief that Donald Trump won't have firsthand witnesses to his misconduct John Bolton seems to be able to speak to article 1 the the abuse of power John Bolton based on the New York Times report witnessed what he viewed was the holdup of military aid for Ukraine in exchange for anticipation of or an expectation of investigations into the Biden but it's just palpable on all of your face is there today that this battle has been lost well look I know numbers I learned I learned this on the City Council of nine members where an older council member told me boy if you're gonna be a successful City Council person young man you're gonna be successful as the councilman you've got to learn how to count to five and that wasn't we had nine nine counts of people I know how to count to sixty-seven and I know the hurdle that that will be but let me tell you right now and again this goes to the heart of our country never stop being a prisoner of hope our whole country speaks to that that they crush that they beat us at Bunker Hill they bat beat it they bombed us and in the pinna Church in Birmingham they beat us down at Stonewall we've seen horribly painful moments where the very ideals of this nation were under threat that we found ways to gather back together and come back even stronger this election is about so much more now than a choice between a democratic and a Republican president this is not about right or left this is about right or wrong this is a moral moment and the moral vandal that's in the White House right now he may win this day but he will not win our nation we are America and we're gonna find a way to regroup heal and be the moral nation that I know we are Oh Cory Cory you guys tell you it's Claire and you know I needed that just then do so much I needed that I needed to hear you say that you have a way of making us hopeful and uplifting everyone and I hope you say it over and over and over again because we're all gonna need to hear it I think over the next couple of days back is another hostage of hope though and give you a second part to Claire to speak - I mean if eliot engel put out a statement less than 24 hours ago with another smoking gun here that he had a revelation from john bolton himself who called his office and suggested he investigate Murry Ivanovich why isn't the fight still underway to get one more Republican vote just to hear what the guy has to say yeah I look you're gonna see that you're gonna see a long period of questions where I think you're gonna hear Democrats over and over again driving home this point that the truth is not somewhere hard to find bring balton in narrow his testimony stipulate that there are things he should not talk about but to speak to the matters that just Donald Trump has already spoke to right he said the call was perfect what do you know specifically about the truth of the matter that he is asserting limit the testimony to jest to that but the American public hear what's going on but they can't they are afraid of the truth they can't handle the truth and they know that the truth will may set this nation free but it might not send Donald Trump shackle to the annual annals of ignominy senator please come back any time you have a chance that's great to hear from you great - great to hear I just tell you my favorite moment yesterday was when Clinton would Claire McCaskill's name was pulled out on the Senate floor we took such Glee and joy in the darkness and the depressing circumstances to hear her name on that Senate floor we love you we miss you Claire well we we were sad for you that you don't have her among your ranks but we're very happy and very proud and very grateful to have her among ours thank you for spending some time with us there
