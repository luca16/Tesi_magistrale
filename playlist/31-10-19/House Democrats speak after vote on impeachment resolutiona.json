    "DOCUMENT" : "all right so this is a sad and somber time in the history of the United States of America for the fourth time in our history we are compelled by Ella gated allegations of presidential wrongdoing so serious that we are engaged in an impeachment inquiry well none of us ran for office to impeach a president everyone on this stage agrees that we have put into place a fair series of procedures to govern how this process moves forward these procedures are guided by the precedent Congress said under previous impeachment they guarantee protections for the president in his counsel that were not explicitly provided during prior impeachments and they lay out a clear path forward so that the American people can hear firsthand the serious and alarming allegations about president Trump's abuse of power I'm proud of the resolution we put together I believe that it will withstand the test of time I'm proud of the work of the Rules Committee and and even though it gets somewhat contentious last night I want to say I'm probably the way all members Democrats and Republicans conducted themselves there was no live streaming and narration during the mark-up nobody stormed the committee nobody sees the microphone people behaved I think in a way that is respectful of this institution and I appreciate the cooperation of ranking member Tom Cole and the other Republicans as well I want to thank all the committee chairs here for their hard work to uncover the truth on behalf of the American people this vote is a victory not for not this vote is a victory not not for any of us but on behalf of the constituents who sent us here and who demand that we follow the facts and uphold our oath I also want to thank two courageous civil servants who have come forward to testify so far many in contradiction of this administration's attempts to silence them and at great risk to their own career let me conclude with this I truly believe that a hundred years from now historians will look back at this moment and judge us by decisions we are making here today at the end of the day this risen this resolution isn't about Donald Trump it isn't about any of us it's about our Constitution and it's about our country and now I'm happy to yield to the distinguished chair of the Select Committee on Intelligence Adam chef I think the gentleman for yielding this is a solemn day in the history of our country when the president's misconduct has compelled us to continue to move forward with an impeachment inquiry the resolution today sets out the procedures going forward with that impeachment process the founding fathers understood that a leader might take hold of the Oval Office who would sacrifice the national security who would fail to defend the Constitution who would place his personal or political interests above the interests of the country they understood that might happen and they provided a mechanism to deal with it and that mechanism is called impeachment we take no joy in having to move down this road and proceed with the impeachment inquiry but neither do we shrink from it the resolution from the perspective of the Intelligence Committee sets out important procedures for how we may conduct our open hearings during the depositions that we've conducted thus for we've used a format that we believe very conducive to the fact-finding process those procedures now will be incorporated into the open hearings in which staff counsel will be permitted for lengthy periods of time to do sustained questioning for up to 25 minutes per side followed by member questioning we've used this I think to great success for both parties during the course of the depositions wherein the depositions we have alternated one hour for the majority one hour for the minority forty-five minutes for the majority 45 minutes for the minority in those depositions over a hundred members have been eligible to participate I should tell you that notwithstanding those that have complained about lack of access to the depositions most of the members who have been permitted to attend have failed to attend have not made use of the availability of attending each and every deposition but those that have on both sides of the aisle have had an equal opportunity to question the witnesses and indeed when we move into open session both parties will have an equal opportunity to question any witnesses that are called the resident resolution will also permit as the chair to release to begin releasing the transcripts of the depositions and I think that you will see when those are released just what Equal Opportunity members of both parties have had we recognize the seriousness of this undertaking we recognize that we have been compelled by the circumstances to move forward when a president abuses his or her office when a president sacrifices the national interest when a president refuses to defend the Constitution and does so for the purpose of advancing a personal or political agenda the founders provided the remedy I make no prejudgment as to whether that remedy will be warranted when we finish these hearings I will wait until all the facts are put forward we will undertake this duty with the seriousness it deserves and to the best of our ability thank you and I now yield to the chair of the Judiciary Committee mr. Nadler thank you very much no person Republican or Democrat president or anyone else should be permitted to jeopardize America's security and reputation for self-serving political purposes no president no official can demand that an ally of the United States do anything in particular to help his or her political ambitions as a condition of receiving help from our country if after a fair and thorough inquiry the allegations against President Trump are found to be true they would represent the profound offense against the Constitution and against the people of this country it is the duty of the house to vindicate the Constitution and to make it crystal clear to future presidents that this kind of conduct if proven is an affront to the great public that place their trust in him or her this resolution that we passed today lays the groundwork for open hearings in both the Intelligence Committee and the Judiciary Committee the house and the American public must see all the evidence for themselves the resolution makes clear the ample safeguards in the process that will be given and that will be adhered to the resolution is necessary to ensure that our constitutional order remains intact for future generations what we have seen our allegations of conduct on many levels that if proven to be true are a challenge to the democratic order to democratic norms in which we all depend we must hand this country to our children with its democracy in as good a shape as when it was handed to us we simply have no choice because no one can be above the law and we must enforce that I'll now yield to the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee mr. Engel thank you i'm eliot engel chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee for the last month we've been working lockstep with the intelligence and oversight committees on this impeachment inquiry so far we've seen damning evidence but the president abused his power and jeopardized our national security but to help his own political fortunes he pressed for another round of foreign interference in an American election its what the framers feared the most today we've laid the groundwork for the next open phase of this investigation moving ahead the Foreign Affairs Committee will continue to support this effort because we know that the administration's abusive power resulted in our foreign policy being subverted and our diplomats being smeared sidelined and harassed we cannot stand for that I'm glad that the resolution we passed today will provide for an open fair process that will allow the American people to hear from witnesses see the evidence and understand the troubling story of what the president and his allies did they deserve to know the facts and they soon will thank you and now it's my pleasure to call on carolyn Maloney the acting chair of the\n",

            "BASE" : "all right so this is a sad and somber time in the history of the United States of America for the fourth time in our history we are compelled by Ella gated allegations of presidential wrongdoing so serious that we are engaged in an impeachment inquiry well none of us ran for office to impeach a president everyone on this stage agrees that we have put into place a fair series of procedures to govern how this process moves forward these procedures are guided by the precedent Congress said under previous impeachment they guarantee protections for the president in his counsel that were not explicitly provided during prior impeachments and they lay out a clear path forward so that the American people can hear firsthand the serious and alarming allegations about president Trump's abuse of power I'm proud of the resolution we put together I believe that it will withstand the test of time I'm proud of the work of the Rules Committee and and even though it gets somewhat contentious last night I want to say I'm probably the way all members Democrats and Republicans conducted themselves there was no live streaming and narration during the mark-up nobody stormed the committee nobody sees the microphone people behaved I think in a way that is respectful of this institution and I appreciate the cooperation of ranking member Tom Cole and the other Republicans as well I want to thank all the committee chairs here for their hard work to uncover the truth on behalf of the American people this vote is a victory not for not this vote is a victory not not for any of us but on behalf of the constituents who sent us here and who demand that we follow the facts and uphold our oath I also want to thank two courageous civil servants who have come forward to testify so far many in contradiction of this administration's attempts to silence them and at great risk to their own career let me conclude with this I truly believe that a hundred years from now historians will look back at this moment and judge us by decisions we are making here today at the end of the day this risen this resolution isn't about Donald Trump it isn't about any of us it's about our Constitution and it's about our country and now I'm happy to yield to the distinguished chair of the Select Committee on Intelligence Adam chef I think the gentleman for yielding this is a solemn day in the history of our country when the president's misconduct has compelled us to continue to move forward with an impeachment inquiry the resolution today sets out the procedures going forward with that impeachment process the founding fathers understood that a leader might take hold of the Oval Office who would sacrifice the national security who would fail to defend the Constitution who would place his personal or political interests above the interests of the country they understood that might happen and they provided a mechanism to deal with it and that mechanism is called impeachment we take no joy in having to move down this road and proceed with the impeachment inquiry but neither do we shrink from it the resolution from the perspective of the Intelligence Committee sets out important procedures for how we may conduct our open hearings during the depositions that we've conducted thus for we've used a format that we believe very conducive to the fact-finding process those procedures now will be incorporated into the open hearings in which staff counsel will be permitted for lengthy periods of time to do sustained questioning for up to 25 minutes per side followed by member questioning we've used this I think to great success for both parties during the course of the depositions wherein the depositions we have alternated one hour for the majority one hour for the minority forty-five minutes for the majority 45 minutes for the minority in those depositions over a hundred members have been eligible to participate I should tell you that notwithstanding those that have complained about lack of access to the depositions most of the members who have been permitted to attend have failed to attend have not made use of the availability of attending each and every deposition but those that have on both sides of the aisle have had an equal opportunity to question the witnesses and indeed when we move into open session both parties will have an equal opportunity to question any witnesses that are called the resident resolution will also permit as the chair to release to begin releasing the transcripts of the depositions and I think that you will see when those are released just what Equal Opportunity members of both parties have had we recognize the seriousness of this undertaking we recognize that we have been compelled by the circumstances to move forward when a president abuses his or her office when a president sacrifices the national interest when a president refuses to defend the Constitution and does so for the purpose of advancing a personal or political agenda the founders provided the remedy I make no prejudgment as to whether that remedy will be warranted when we finish these hearings I will wait until all the facts are put forward we will undertake this duty with the seriousness it deserves and to the best of our ability thank you and I now yield to the chair of the Judiciary

presidential wrongdoing so serious that we are engaged in an impeachment inquiry well none of us ran for office to impeach a president everyone on this stage agrees that we have put into place a fair series of procedures to govern how this process moves forward these procedures are guided by the precedent Congress said under previous impeachment they guarantee protections for the president in his counsel that were not explicitly provided during prior impeachments and they lay out a clear path forward so that the American people can hear firsthand the serious and alarming allegations about president Trump's abuse of power I'm proud of the resolution we put together I believe that it will withstand the test of time I'm proud of the work of the Rules Committee and and even though it gets somewhat contentious last night I want to say I'm probably the way all members Democrats and Republicans conducted themselves there was no live streaming and narration during the mark-up nobody stormed the committee nobody sees the microphone people behaved I think in a way that is respectful of this institution and I appreciate the cooperation of ranking member Tom Cole and the other Republicans as well I want to thank all the committee chairs here for their hard work to uncover the truth on behalf of the American people this vote is a victory not for not this vote is a victory not not for any of us but on behalf of the constituents who sent us here and who demand that we follow the facts and uphold our oath I also want to thank two courageous civil servants who have come forward to testify so far many in contradiction of this administration's attempts to silence them and at great risk to their own career let me conclude with this I truly believe that a hundred years from now historians will look back at this moment and judge us by decisions we are making here today at the end of the day this risen this resolution isn't about Donald Trump it isn't about any of us it's about our Constitution and it's about our country and now I'm happy to yield to the distinguished chair of the Select Committee on Intelligence Adam chef I think the gentleman for yielding this is a solemn day in the history of our country when the president's misconduct has compelled us to continue to move forward with an impeachment inquiry the resolution today sets out the procedures going forward with that impeachment process the founding fathers understood that a leader might take hold of the Oval Office who would sacrifice the national security who would fail to defend the Constitution who would place his personal or political interests above the interests of the country they understood that might happen and they provided a mechanism to deal with it and that mechanism is called impeachment we take no joy in having to move down this road and proceed with the impeachment inquiry but neither do we shrink from it the resolution from the perspective of the Intelligence Committee sets out important procedures for how we may conduct our open hearings during the depositions that we've conducted thus for we've used a format that we believe very conducive to the fact-finding process those procedures now will be incorporated into the open hearings in which staff counsel will be permitted for lengthy periods of time to do sustained questioning for up to 25 minutes per side followed by member questioning we've used this I think to great success for both parties during the course of the depositions wherein the depositions we have alternated one hour for the majority one hour for the minority forty-five minutes for the majority 45 minutes for the minority in those depositions over a hundred members have been eligible to participate I should tell you that notwithstanding those that have complained about lack of access to the depositions most of the members who have been permitted to attend have failed to attend have not made use of the availability of attending each and every deposition but those that have on both sides of the aisle have had an equal opportunity to question the witnesses and indeed when we move into open session both parties will have an equal opportunity to question any witnesses that are called the resident resolution will also permit as the chair to release to begin releasing the transcripts of the depositions and I think that you will see when those are released just what Equal Opportunity members of both parties have had we recognize the seriousness of this undertaking we recognize that we have been compelled by the circumstances to move forward when a president abuses his or her office when a president sacrifices the national interest when a president refuses to defend the Constitution and does so for the purpose of advancing a personal or political agenda the founders provided the remedy I make no prejudgment as to whether that remedy will be warranted when we finish these hearings

is a solemn day in the history of our country when the president's misconduct has compelled us to continue to move forward with an impeachment inquiry the resolution today sets out the procedures going forward with that impeachment process the founding fathers understood that a leader might take hold of the Oval Office who would sacrifice the national security who would fail to defend the Constitution who would place his personal or political interests above the interests of the country they understood that might happen and they provided a mechanism to deal with it and that mechanism is called impeachment we take no joy in having to move down this road and proceed with the impeachment inquiry but neither do we shrink from it the resolution from the perspective of the Intelligence Committee sets out important procedures for how we may conduct our open hearings during the depositions that we've conducted thus for we've used a format that we believe very conducive to the fact-finding process those procedures now will be incorporated into the open hearings in which staff counsel will be permitted for lengthy periods of time to do sustained questioning for up to 25

the majority one hour for the minority forty-five minutes for the majority 45 minutes for the minority in those depositions over a hundred members have been eligible to participate I should tell you that notwithstanding those that have complained about lack of access to the depositions most of the members who have been permitted to attend have failed to attend have not made use of the

series of procedures to govern how this process moves forward these procedures are guided by the precedent Congress said under previous impeachment they guarantee protections for the president in his counsel that were not explicitly provided during prior impeachments and they lay out a clear path forward so that the American people can hear firsthand the serious and alarming allegations about

not not for any of us but on behalf of the constituents who sent us here and who demand that we follow the facts and uphold our oath I also want to thank two courageous civil servants who have come

is a solemn day in the history of our country when the president's misconduct has compelled us to continue to move forward with an impeachment inquiry the resolution today sets out the procedures going forward with that impeachment process the founding fathers understood that a leader might take hold of the Oval Office who would sacrifice the national security who would fail to defend the Constitution who would place his personal or political interests above the interests of the country they understood that might happen and they provided a mechanism to deal with it and that mechanism is called impeachment we take no joy in having to move down this road and proceed with the impeachment inquiry but neither do we shrink from it the resolution from the perspective of the Intelligence Committee sets out important procedures for how we may conduct our open hearings during the depositions that we've conducted thus for we've used a format that we believe very conducive to the fact-finding process those procedures now will be incorporated into the open hearings in which staff counsel will be permitted for lengthy periods of time to do sustained questioning for up to 25

the majority one hour for the minority forty-five minutes for the majority 45 minutes for the minority in those depositions over a hundred members have been eligible to participate I should tell you that notwithstanding those that have complained about lack of access to the depositions most of the members who have been permitted to attend have failed to attend have not made use of the

presidential wrongdoing so serious that we are engaged in an impeachment inquiry well none of us ran for office to impeach a president everyone on this stage agrees that we have put into place a fair series of procedures to govern how this process moves forward these procedures are guided by the precedent Congress said under previous impeachment they guarantee protections for the president in his counsel that were not explicitly provided during prior impeachments and they lay out a clear path forward so that the American people can hear firsthand the serious and alarming allegations about president Trump's abuse of power I'm proud of the resolution we put together I believe that it will withstand the test of time I'm proud of the work of the Rules Committee and and even though it gets somewhat contentious last night I want to say I'm probably the way all members Democrats and Republicans conducted themselves there was no live streaming and narration during the mark-up nobody stormed the committee nobody sees the microphone people behaved I think in a way that is respectful of this institution and I appreciate the cooperation of ranking member Tom Cole and the other Republicans as well I want to thank all the committee chairs here for their hard work to uncover the truth on behalf of the American people this vote is a victory not for not this vote is a victory not not for any of us but on behalf of the constituents who sent us here and who demand that we follow the facts and uphold our oath I also want to thank two courageous civil servants who have come forward to testify so far many in contradiction of this administration's attempts to silence them and at great risk to their own career let me conclude with this I truly believe that a hundred years

it's about our Constitution and it's about our country and now I'm happy to yield to the distinguished chair of the Select Committee on Intelligence Adam chef I think the gentleman for yielding this is a solemn day in the history of our country when the president's misconduct has compelled us to continue to move forward with an impeachment inquiry the resolution today sets out the procedures going forward with that impeachment process the founding fathers understood that a leader might take hold of the Oval Office who would sacrifice the national security who would fail to defend the Constitution who would place his personal or political interests above the interests of the country they understood that might happen and they provided a mechanism to deal with it and that mechanism is called impeachment we take no joy in having to move down this road and proceed with the impeachment inquiry but neither do we shrink from it the resolution from the perspective of the Intelligence Committee sets out important procedures for how we may conduct our open hearings during the depositions that we've conducted thus for we've used a format that we believe very conducive to the fact-finding process those procedures now will be incorporated into the open hearings in which staff counsel will be permitted for lengthy periods of time to do sustained questioning for up to 25 minutes per side followed by member questioning we've used this I think to great success for both parties during the course of the depositions wherein the depositions we have alternated one hour for the majority one hour for the minority forty-five minutes for the majority 45 minutes for the minority in those depositions over a hundred members have been eligible to participate I should tell you

that notwithstanding those that have complained about lack of access to the depositions most of the members who have been permitted to attend have failed to attend have not made use of the

both parties will have an equal opportunity to question any witnesses that are called the resident resolution will also permit as the chair to release to begin releasing the transcripts of the
