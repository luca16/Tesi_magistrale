Oversight Committee thank you I will be brief it I have just two points first I want to commend my colleagues for their diligent work this is a very grave matter as they have shown we are acting deliberatively thoroughly and without delay secondly I want to remind everyone of the words of our beloved former chairman Elijah Cummings and quote he said we are fighting for the soul of democracy in quote that is our core mission under the Constitution we cannot allow a president or any president to extort foreign countries and to interfering with our democracy we cannot allow a president to withhold critical military aid that we have in Congress provided in order to counter Russian aggression and we cannot allow a present to ignore duly authorized subpoenas with held documents prevent witnesses from test testifying covering up wrongdoing and obstructing kind this is a fundamental corruption of the Constitution and abuse of power and a breach of the oath of office thank you and I yield now to the chairman of our caucus Hakeem Jeffries Thank You congresswoman Maloney I thank the distinguished chairs for their diligent work throughout this process this is not a celebratory moment here in the capital city this is a solemn moment it's a sober moment it's a serious moment none of us came to Congress to impeach this president or any president but duty now requires that we investigate the serious wrongdoing that is hiding in plain sight this is a moment for every single member of the House of Representatives to put principle over party to put the Constitution above corruption to put democracy above dereliction of duty this is not a moment this impeachment inquiry is not about Democrats versus Republicans it's not about the left versus the right it's not about progressives versus conservatives the impeachment inquiry is about right versus wrong and we have a constitutional responsibility to follow the facts apply to law be guided by the Constitution and present the evidence of wrongdoing to the American people the impeachment inquiry is about abuse of power it's about betrayal it's about corruption it's about national security to mount the integrity of our elections it's about defending our democracy for the people with that I think we have an opportunity to take just a handful of questions well the process that has been set forth by speaker Pelosi from the very beginning is that we are operating under an impeachment inquiry umbrella where there are six Committees of relevant jurisdiction that will explore the wrongdoing that exists coming out of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and at the end of the process make recommendations to the chair and the Judiciary Committee with a continued focus on the Trump Ukraine scandal the abuse of power the solicitation of foreign interference in the 2020 election and that inquiry of course will continue to be led by Chairman Adam Schiff and the Intel committee because it relates to a matter of national security but to expand on your question we're not going to speculate on that now but we'll see what happens we're not going to speculate on that now that you should really ask chairman Schiff and it depends on on the speed with the speed with which things go there and I can't answer that question again you should ask chairman Schiff that but obviously any testimony is very important testimony especially from someone so so located so crucially located well it's it's it's elementary that we're one party to litigation unlawfully blocks the the investigation as this president has been doing although we hope you won't continue doing it you may have to take some steps that we may have to joy that versa inferences we may have to do other things we'll see I'm not considering anything at the moment we'll see what it what happens I interpret that the Republicans are ignoring evidence that they don't want to see a proper investigation theory that's all I can do up last question well your first question was the timeline I don't know we don't know it depends it depends on obviously how many witnesses etc I can't speculate on that the second question is remember the the Intelligence Committee is doing a basic investigative job a job that in past impeachment was done by by the star Commission or by the Ervin committee etc once it goes to judiciary it's a different stage and it's a more it's a different stage it's not the initial fact finding stage and it's proper that the President had more more recourse at that point I remember the minority the Republicans have the same rights and rights to call witnesses to examine witnesses etcetera in Intel they will have the same rights in judiciary but once against judiciary if we're carrying on impeachment if there's been a recommendation of for an impeachment that we're carrying on that our that investigation that inquiry at that point then the president were to have more rights than in the initial fact-finding stage president yesterday directed his Republican defenders to focus on substance that's what House Democrats have been doing from the very beginning and we invite our Republican colleagues pursuant to the direction of the President to do the same what is this all about Congress on a bipartisan basis allocated 391 million dollars to Ukraine in military and economic assistance because we deemed it in our national security interest Ukraine right now is under attack from Russian backed separatists Ukraine is a friend Russia is a foe Ukraine is a democracy Russia is a dictatorship the United States may very well be the only thing standing between Vladimir Putin and Ukraine being completely overrun by Russia as part of his fantasy to reconstruct what he views as the glory days of the Soviet Union in that context Congress allocated the 391 million dollars in a bipartisan fashion in February the administration wrote to Congress and said the aid is on the way but it never showed up and then in May the Trump just the Trump Department of Defense wrote to Congress again and said the aid is on the way and in that letter said all necessary preconditions have been met by the new Ukrainian government including the implementation of anti-corruption protocols that was in the letter that was sent by Trump's Department of Defense in May and yet the aide never showed up twice during the summer Mitch McConnell called up the Trump administration and said where's the aide Mitch McConnell couldn't get a good answer and then on July 18th at the White House the Office of Management and Budget holds a meeting Mulvaney is there apparently where they say the reason that Aid has not been released is at the explicit direction of the President of the United States of America on July 25th one week later we understand why his own words do us a favor though pressuring a foreign government to target an American citizen for political gain and thereby solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election while withholding this aid from a vulnerable Ukraine mr. president that's the substance of the matter that's what we're going to focus on moving forward thank you let me let me add to that and say that foreign aid is a very important component of what of what we do around the world in order to to keep America really at the top of the world and the money that the Congress allocated for foreign aid was not the president's personal pinata that he can use however he wants by withholding that money he's taking an asset of the United States not a personal asset of the United States and withholding it to try to coerce the leader of an the country to help him in his political election I mean if that isn't crazy then I don't know what is so this really just cannot stand foreign aid is not the president's personal pinata to do what he wants with it the Congress appropriates it and Ukraine is in a very important crossroads right now and so this is a very very serious matter the foreign country it's a matter of taking American money that the Congress allocated for foreign aid for country to withhold it and state of that leader I'm not going to give it to you unless you do what I need you to do that is an absolute disgrace and that's one of the reasons we're here
