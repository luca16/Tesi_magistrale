  <p class="txt1">The impeachment of Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States, occurred on December 18,
    2019, when the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives approved articles of impeachment on charges of abuse of
    power and obstruction of Congress. <br>
    Trump was acquitted by the Republican-controlled Senate on these two counts of impeachment on February 5, 2020.</p>
